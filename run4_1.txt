Chorus:
When's my baby getting coffee?
When's my baby getting coffee
In the morning?
Just as I duck into the bath
I jerk and flail about
Like a spider on a string
Never quite sure where to turn
My stomach is screaming at me
Stop!
There's got to be more than this one
Like a big old cluster of cottonwoods
I gotta be a-plenty
Like a good farmer knows
I gotta be smart
I gotta be tough
And I gotta be strong
There comes a moment in your life
Like a shot in the dark
And you're so afraid
You don't know whether or not to laugh
Or cry
Or stay put
And you're so focused
You don't know if you're gonna stand
You gotta grab for whatever you can find
Hold on let me pull you up
See that's where you're standing
Now is the time
(Chorus Repeat)

I've never been the girl
For getting nowhere
In life and love
I've been told
Don't change
Don't change
So I stay the same
Nothing has changed
My life hasn't
Changed all that much
Just my size
I stay the same
Nothing has changed
Since the start
Like the clock's ticking
Down to the bare nessesities
My heart is pierced by
I need to sing of love
Courage has flown
I'd been there before
Needing a moment to myself
I turn away
He's not my type
And I hope that this is the start
Of a new and brighter birth
I send out a cheer

I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
To hold me here
But they're gone now
My father's in mourning
I send him my love
'Come all you pretty flowers'
'Please don't take our honey
He's in love
With no strings on me
I'm feeling blue
I see him
I'm feeling green
There's no mistaking
Who I am
And I'm falling apart
Just see
What he's made of
What he's made of
I've got strings
So I guess I've got
Birds
And fish
And reptiles
I've got feet
And I might just
Take a walk around the block
There's nothing
stuck in place
I know he's heart
In love
Yes, I've got strings
I've got no strings
To hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown
I had strings
To hold me down
But I'm free
To run

Just don't let Wreck-It Land get away with this thing
Cause Wreck-It Land is nothing like the pristine Ralph we know and love
Wreck-It Land is a criminal enterprise
Ralph is a super guy
Ralph is an expert
He can outsmart a lot of crooks
In fact, he's probably outsmarting them all
Because of Wreck-It Land's many tricks and exploits
Like:
1. Ralph's got a brain
That's beyond compare
2. Ralph's got a grub
That's beyond compare
3. Ralph's got a mind
That's beyond compare
4. Wreck-It Land uses its great size
To its advantage
Ralph's got wicked looks
That's beyond compare
And it's because of these extra tricks and maneuvers
That Wreck-It Land consistently tops the heap
Not the trash can that we see
Nor the time when they hauled him by the paw
Nor the withering grub found in his wake
Nor the time when they fed him slop
Nor the time when he begged for scraps
From the moment when he came
To the moment that he was finished
Wreck-It Ralph has got style
That's beyond compare
Ralph's got fiddles
That's beyond compare
And it's because of these extra tricks and maneuvers
That Wreck-It Land consistently tops the heap

Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see them, I don't even care if it's day or night
They'll be there for me, my love
When the world goes wrong, I can still be here
So I'll be right here,
To take their hand and show them,
That I am not some crazy moon that's so high up there
I can take a hint,
And a curse, and a nightmare could end
The way I can,
Make them go away,
Shut them up,
That's how you know,
I can make you go away,
Shut them up,
That's how you know
You can kiss the stars for shining so bright
When the night is cold,
The sky will shimmer with diamonds
In my lap they'll be warm and real,
When the world goes wrong, I can still be here
So, I'll be right here,
Till you know,
I can make you stay.

I've known each child since they can speak
I've seen their smiling faces,
I've heard them laugh,
And it fills me with pleasure
To see them melt away
Like snow...
In another world,
I'd be there for them too.
My arms are long,
I'm tough,
I'm handsome,
And I know all the ways
To make them feel,
The way they do on my skin.
Like lead...
In their world.
I'd dress them in their favorite color,
And I'd paint them all red,
To honor the dead.
They'd have a flamingo in their yard,
A pheasant on their tree,
A lioness in their bed,
A hippogriff on their deck.
All their birds would sing songs,
All their flowers would squeeze,
If they could,
They'd make love at once.

I am a question to the world,
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms.
And what do you think you'd ever say?
I won't listen anyway.
You don't know me,
And I’ll never be what you want me to be.
And how can you know which way is up and which way is down?
No one knows me,
So I’ll walk around,
Sail on a blue sea,
Until I find my world.
And then I want to run to you.
So you can be there for me too.
So you can be the shining city that I know you can be.
So you can take my hand and make me feel like a holiday.
A vacation, nothing to see or do.
A time to let off steam,
And which way should we go next?
Up or down?
Up or left,
Up or right.
I want to fly,
I want to fly,
I want to fly.
And then I want to hold you so close.
So we can be together as one.
So we can call home.
And if all else has been forgotten
Then at least
We can call each other by our names.
I want to be out there,
Riding on the wind,
Shining like the sun,
Shining like the sun.
And when the night is through
I want to be at your service,
Riding on the wind,
Shining like the sun,
Shining like the sun.

But Wreck-It Ralph doesn't speak
So his world goes black
Every time he's surprised
By a dream he can't explain
And he knows the reason it's so hard
Is because he's so darn tall
Wreck-It Ralph has got a lot to learn
From his terrible experience with chub
Riches heaped on him by his mother
He's been kicked, cursed, insulted,
Cried upon, shoved, pulled
Down to his level
And he's not even halfway through
The longest standing, grinnin' joke
In this world's great beyond compare
Riches heaped on him by his mother
They call him "Dad"
But Wreck-It Ralph doesn't speak
So his world goes black
Every time he's surprised
By a dream he can't explain
And he knows the reason it's so hard
Is because he's so darn tall
Wreck-It Ralph has got a lot to learn
From his terrible experience with chub
Riches heaped on him by his mother
He's been kicked, cursed, insulted,
Cried upon, pushed, pulled
Down to his level
And he's not even halfway through
The longest standing, grinnin' joke
In this world's great beyond compare
Riches heaped on him by his mother
They call him "Dad"
But Wreck-It Ralph doesn't speak
So his world goes black
Every time he's surprised
By a dream he can't explain
And he knows the reason it's so hard
Is because he's so darn tall
Wreck-It Ralph has got a lot to learn
From his terrible experience with chub
Riches heaped on him by his mother
He's been kicked, cursed, insulted,
Cried upon, shoved, pulled
Down to his level
And he's not even halfway through
The longest standing, grinnin' joke
In this world's great beyond compare
Riches heaped on him by his
MOTHER
MOTHER
And I will defend him
Riches heaped on him by his
SISTER

SOURCE -  Wreck-It Ralph
REMEMBER WHEN
I SAID THAT 
WE'D GO ON A SCIENCE FICTION
Ralph is on the march again
Chasing a Scoville index
From Zero to 200
Fast-forward to today
And He's sold more than a billion books
And he's one of those rarer folk
Like you or I
Who can HIDE A SCIENCE FICTION
From CAPTAIN AMERICA: STEVE DREAM
Onwards and upwards
Like a relentless stream
Rising to the top
Like a relentless cyclone
CHORUS:
I've seen things, believe it or not
And it's a terrifying sight
A thing called a Dream
Ain't nothing like it, ever
And I salute you, sir
For forcing my hand
And allowing me to explore
The Depths
The Dream
Beyond the Gate
Beyond the Gate
(Chorus Repeat) 
CHORUS:
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my brains
Could it be?
Is this really happening?
Is this what dreams are made of?
No, no, sorry boys
Can't believe my ears
They're out of whack
What's going on?
I keep hoping and praying
That some day, some day
I'll find my way
To the Other Side
And I can't believe it
It's like the tide, always flowing
In the other direction
I keep hoping and praying
That some day, some day
I'll find my way
To the Other Side
And I can't believe it
It's like the tide, always flowing
In the other direction
I keep hoping and praying
That some day, some day
I'll find my way
To the Other Side

TITLE: I Just Can't Wait To Be King
Simba: I'm gonna be a mighty king
Just a mighty king
Just a mighty king
Saying: Be my guest
At the Pint of the New Moon
We surrender to your majesty
Yes, we do
There's no disagreement
To the matter that may arise
From your hospitality
Yes, we all share
The common goal
To serve and protect
Our dear friend
As you see fit
So, set your camp and prepare to ride
Your mighty steed
With all your might
You'll be king
Yes, king
We'll send a hail of arrows
Upon your castle walls
You'll be king
We'll lay siege to your castle
For as long as you are king
We'll be your lords
As long as you are king
