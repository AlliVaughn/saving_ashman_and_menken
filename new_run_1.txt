TITLE: If you could grow tall and thin and gay
And if you could learn to do so without
The guilt and the shame
Then you'd be a happy creature
No one taught you this lesson

No one taught you that fear can have a funny way of feeling
[Chorus]
If you could learn to do so without

Going to the marina
Anywhere near the marina
Is where you're supposed to be
And the reason why
You're not is...

TITLE: It's My Party
Everybody dance
Oh it's my party
At least twice the price
But no charge for wasted champagne
'Cause nobody cares
About my hair or my makeup
It's just a few dollars a night
That I can use to pay for my drinks
And my shoes
And my Gucci watch
No one complains
About my bill of sale
That says "it's my party"
It's my party because
I drank half the glass
And I've paid the bill
But I want to pay the bill now
I'd rather have had half the glass
I want the chance to prove it
Cause nobody cares
About my party or my wine
It's just my party
Everybody dance
Oh it's my party
Everybody dance
Everybody dance

TITLE: You And Me
(Demi:) 
When your life is upside down and yay!
Just take a look and see what's in store.
You'll be swept up in a song that perfectly describes
your future.
You'll be part of a love that can lift your spirits at anytime.
All you have to do is pull the trigger.
Cause let's face it, love's a game, love's a sport.
Who woulda thunk thought that love could be so relaxing.
When your life is upside down and yay!
Just take a look and see what's in store.
You'll be swept up in a song that perfectly describes your future
You'll be part of a love that can lift your spirits at anytime.
All you have to do is pull the trigger.
Cause let's face it, love's a game, love's a sport.
Who woulda thunk thought that love could be so relaxing.
When your life is upside down and yay!
Just pull the trigger and end it all.

TITLE: In The Name Of Love
Lyrics
In the name of love
I'll search for the true love
Lost and found
And when I find him
I will write him a song
To make him stay
The way he did not lose so easily
In the name of love

====================
TITLE: The Story of Us
When I get to know him
All of my dreams come true
When I'm lost in his thoughts
And everything is new
And love is a river in the sky
There is a story we can share
And it's heartbreaking
And yet somehow romantic
And I'm making it all seem so small
And so real
And yet so true
When I read it to him
He'd say "the story of us is beautiful"
And I'm glad he's glad to see me
Just a story about two lost souls on a desert island
Their hearts full of love
Their hopes and dreams
That their world has been too small
They need another love
A love that will last forever
They'll find another way
And that love will come to them
On the silver sand beneath my feet
A love that will come to you

====================
TITLE: Make a Man Out of You
I want to build a man out of you
I want to build him out of
Me (Me, me, me)
I want to walk like you
Talk like you
Do like
You
Like
You
When you walk away, I want to believe
You'll make a man out of me

====================
TITLE: I'll Save The World
i'll save the world
i'll make the sun shine bright

====================
TITLE: Happy Together
The way our happiness seems so strong and true
When everything seems to be falling in
We both find we are reaching for each other's hearts and
And although there is sadness there is also joy
And although there is hurt there is also love
There is "now" and nothing to cling to
There is "now" and nothing to cling to
There is now and nothing to cling to
There is now and nothing to cling to

====================
TITLE: Heaven's Light
So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair
Of lovers walking in the night
And dreamed a happy tale
But when the moon was just beginning to roll
Through the window I could hear them talking
And I knew it was too late to call the police
But I'd rather be safe than sorry
So I climbed on top of the bird and kissed the cat
And went inside thinking it would be ok
Because I have now entered into heaven's light

====================
TITLE: A Guy Like Me
A guy like me
Can learn to be a gal
Too
He'll put you in a mood
Someone who is just like me
Can learn to be a guy
Too
And it'll be so much better for it
So say you'll meet a guy like me
After all this waiting
Just around the river bend
Just a couple of blocks from my old stomping ground
Just a block from where I grew up
Just a block from where I'd last seen my dad
Just a heartbeat away
Just a heartbeat away
Just a heartbeat away
Just a heartbeat away
This is my way of saying goodbye
This is my way of saying goodbye
Just a guy like me
Can learn to be gal
Too
Someone who is just like me
Can learn to be a guy
Too
And it'll be so much better for it
So say you'll meet a guy like me

====================
TITLE: If I Never Knew You
I was a child at ease, and now I'm an adult with purpose
I learned early on that trust and morals are the new base
When things don't go your way, blame not the past
But most importantly, never to give up
Life is full of twists and turns and never to stop
If I never knew you
I'd spend my life trying to understand
But trust but most importantly,
Morals and ethics and I will stand by your side
I've turned my back on time and again
And though at times I've tried, at last I find something true
And right now, all I want is to be with you
I've been adrift and adrift-free
And though at times I've tried, at last I find something true
And right now, all I want is to be with you

TITLE: I'll Make A Man Out Of You
I've put my faith in boys like you
Experiment and see what happens
You don't get a medal for bravery
You don't get a medal for courage
I know what the verdict is
You got no chance of ever believing
I'm not the only one with a dream
You don't get a medal for bravery
You don't get a medal for courage
I made a man out of you
Took a chance on you and got lucky
You don't get a medal for bravery

You ain't never gonna dream, don't find
You ain't never gonna dream, don't know
You ain't never gonna find, don't touch
You ain't never gonna find, never touch
You ain't never gonna find, never touch
Once upon a time, yes, once upon a time
You were by your side, always by your side
And if I had a dollar for every bouquet of your beautiful oil
It would buy me everything I need
Everything I want
I don't need no more, I don't need no more
The world is my oyster
Where is the man?
We were dancing so jollically
And I can't decide
Where do I belong?
Where is the love?
I know someone's waiting
Years of dreams are finally here
Trying to figure it out
You got a million questions
Yes, just like I need a million
An honest to goodness answer
How come I get to know this guy
He's just a goof, really
You don't catch much,
But you're so damn lucky
You don't miss a thing
Because you're a man among men
And if you don't, you're gonna get shot
You got a million questions
Yes, just like I need a million
An honest to goodness answer
How come I get to know this guy

Don't catch much,

The legend of Zelda
The legend of Zelda
He rides a blue horse, bears a curious resemblance to a hyena
And this is all because he is so darned smart
Though he is only a hyena
He seems so smart, so shrewd
And so good, so true
He's got intelligence as well
As fathoms below
The bottomless pit of his heart knows no bounds
And he will go to great lengths to prove just why
He is the true hero of his story
Though he's only a hyena
He seems so smart, so shrewd
And so good, so true
He's got intelligence as well
As fathoms below
The bottomless pit of his heart knows no bounds
And he will go to great lengths to prove just why
He is the true hero of his story

I was the one who had it all
I was the master of my fate.
I never needed anybody in my life.
But suddenly, I've found who I am.
This can't be,
Just where are you, boy.
Lost forever.
Where was your sweet, innocent smile?
How could you make me see the truth?
And who could it be, boy?
That I'm no good at all?
That I'm no good at all?
And someone's waiting to love me...

make some noise,
cause when the silence breaks,
the song lyrics make an announcement.
make some noise,
to make sure that the world doesn't come to an end.
Every level of being aware,
makes you stronger.
And when the silent scream
gives way to the rumble of a gun,
the time is drawing near when we can all sing together.

TITLE: The First Time
I was a child prodigy
I could have trained the world's greatest warriors
And made the sun rise from its hiding place
I was once like a star in the sky
I could have lived my fantasy
And never let my dreams slip away
I was once like a dream before my eyes
Now that dream is all behind me
And all that I've ever wanted to be
I have crossed a line
And must learn to walk it again
The first time it's gonna bite
I've built a nightmare
But the nightmare's a far cry from the nightmare that I have made it
So prepare for a roller coaster ride
The first time is the only time
The first time is the only time

TITLE: Don't Lose Your Head
Don't lose your head
you're gonna miss me baby.
Don't lose your head

Your gonna miss my hugging

I will try to comfort ya
Gonna bring you some happiness
some comfort and some serenity
to ease your heart
Ohh you'll find. I've found it.
In short
When you lose your head, you'll find it easier
I'll look for a way to show you that you're welcome
I'm always around to remind you
And even though it seems so far away
I'll keep right by your side at night
So don't lose your head
don't lose your head.

TITLE: The American Adventure
The American adventure begins with you
In these difficult times there is no greater duty than to believe
The only way to freedom is to try
The world is full of dangers and unknowns
And though we know they're out to get us in the night
I will stand by your side
The only way to liberty is to try
The world is cruel and heartless
And though we know it's dark and harsh
There is no lake, there is no shade
And though we know it's cold and dry
There is no shade, there is no ground
For the brave who dare
The world is still unliveable
But if we believe and believe fervently
The world is still childlike
And though we know it's cruel and heartless
It has wings too, and they can fly
And the world is still mysterious
And though we know it's dark and harsh
There is no lake, there is no shade
And though we know it's cold and dry
There is no shade, there is no ground
For the brave who dare
And though we know it's dark and harsh
There is no lake, there is no shade
And though we know it's cold and dry
There is no shade, there is no ground
For the brave who dare
Now the time has come my littlest one
To feel like a princess
A fairytale life can be sweet
Though the danger just around the dam
The love may not be quite so sweet
The sweet caress of twilight
The love with which we're surrounded
By a golden halo
The love that we feel
This fairytale life can be sweet
It can be sweet caress
And when the night winds are through
This sweet caress can last for ever

TITLE: When People Cry
Boys and girls of every age cry
For their fatherland
Mother earth and father sky
Whenever there is a war
There is a story that we all must learn
And put to the test
Every child learns
Basic lessons and suddenly
Out of the blue
There is a joy in the beating of the heart
Like no other
When people cry
For their fatherland
They beg for bread and wine
And when they find them they are served
Like fair maids by their parents
With oil and vinegar
And sometimes cake
But mostly with milk and honey
And sometimes with pepper
And sometimes with onion
And sometimes with garlic
And sometimes with a little bit of--

My name is a little island
In the middle of a big ocean
There's a place where there's a great mysterious boom
And it's almost as if the world is still running
And no one knows how to stop it
My name is a little island
But there's no one here to see or to know
My name is a little island
My name is an island
And it's getting bigger by the day
The people are coming, the chickens are coming,
And the bell hooks are coming, My name is a little island
And I'm getting restless
Because I haven't found a home yet
Where the old man is, what will he say?
My name is a little island
And I'm afraid my old man is a little island
Will he allow me to stay?
My name is a little island
And it's getting harder and harder every day
Because nobody wants to be me
Me too, nobody wants to be me
Me too, nobody wants to be me
Me too, nobody wants to be me
Me too, nobody wants to be me
