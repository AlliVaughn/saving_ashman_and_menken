TITLE: I'm Still Here (Demi Lovato)
If I could take you back to the summer
The music player wouldn't even begin to tell me
What the music player was missing
The TV wasn't even on in the living room
Someday I can take you there too
As a star standing alone
On the big screen in my own little world
If I could take you there back to the summer
The music player would play
The music player would play
I'm still here (speaking) 
If I could take you back to the summer
The TV wasn't even on in the living room
Someday I can take you there back to the summer
The music player would play
The music player would play
It's still the same song, the same song
The same song, same song

The one you love so much.
You gave your life to raise us.
There's no one else to go to but you.
There's no one else to go to but you.
But you can't have Cinderella
If you can't have Cinderella
Why choose her
Over a life that's long past?
You've got to start a new life
Til you find the Prince.
And when you find the Prince.
You'll be so delighted
By the way, he's so tall.
He'll make Cinderella smile
Even if she doesn't know it herself
The way she did smile in the orphanage
Yes, I know it's a bit much
But he's so handsome, and so wonderful, and so strong
It's almost as if he's a fairy tale
Don't you think that's a bit much?
It's a bit much, believe me
It's a bit much, believe me
It's a bit much, believe me

I am not the lost soul who fell so hard for you
You gave me a chance to prove myself
And I would never change anything
You made me a part of something
And all the world is still spinning
I must be doing what I must do
To hold onto it all
If I could, I'd go through life without ever knowing
What you did to me
You left a bad taste in my mouth
But with all the lies and the threats
I can see through them all
Now I know, I know, I know
I'm still here (radio version) 
In this confusing place
I'm still here (radio version) 
Who am I to spend my life alone?
Never knowing why
Did I send you this mess?
Do you even know what you did?
It's over
Now you face the music
And the music plays again
I'll give myself a chance, but I can't see straight
Now is the time, I wanna say it
Now is the time
To say I'm still here
Can you hear your song
Can you hear your life
Song your life
I know you strugge…
Song your life
I know you struggle
Still we'll beat the bush
So put your faith in what you believe in
In the darkness and the rain
Don't look up too far
Out there, they'll come swinging from the trees
Rocking the bush
Slammin' the door
And they'll come knocking
Who's with me
Who's with me

It's a bond that's as sacred as brothers.
If there's one thing we know for sure
It's that our future is bright
And we'll see it through
I will always be with you
Though maybe not with the same intensity
Once we say our goodbyes
You'll be my spirit
With which I'll keep you safe from those who would cut you down
And I will always be with you
I will always be with you

Hungry for the quick and the fat
Newcomers flock to Berlin to work
And the old folks still live in the village square

And the police are mean
So, if you complain, you're a dirty, dangerous man

Not a very responsible thing to do
I'm going to order a double cheeseburger
Two hot dogs and a can of Pepsi
Then I'm going to order a can of Coke
Because that's what I do
I fill my growlers with cola
And I smoke a joint
Before I go outside
I'm going to order a can of soda
And then I'm going to order a double cheeseburger
Wel-wel-welcome!
The other night, my dinner was delayed
Because my wife couldn't make it through
Enough beef jerky to satisfy all my cravings
But I couldn't resist, and I ordered a little food
That my little ones will love
Because it's just a game, they'll love it
They'll think it's cute
And that's a pretty cool thing
Not a very responsible thing to do
I'm going to order a double cheeseburger

Down to the sea
Climb that rope
Walk that plank
Dance with the moon
Look at the smiling face
Not a glance of fear
Will creep up your spine
No, no, no, now that I think of it
I can go no further
Then I can go no further

But I can see the sea floor
From where I can peer under
The sand is slow moving
It's a wonderland
I can see the waves crested
And crested and crested

You know that you can always stare at me?
You'll never know what you are gonna see
So you will go outside your comfort zone
Look me in the eye
Make a face that you will never forget
And you will see the world differently
Then you will go on and live your life
Somewhere out there in the night
Your thoughts and your dreams will come true
There is a world you haven't seen
You will go on and dream your life
And nothing will ever be the same
How the world will turn
You can never see the past
It will be as it is
This is me
And this is me and everything we're missing
And everything we're missing will be
Sky
And it is you
And the moon will come to me
And I'll show you the world
This is me and this is me
Out there in the night
Looking into the eyes of a child
Can change your life
You can never see the past
It will be as it is
This is me
And this is me and everything we're missing
And everything we're missing will be
Sky
And it is you and the world will turn around
This is me and this is me
Out there in the night
Turning my back and letting the darkness overtake me
Turn my back and I'll go on and my life

That's no idle boast
And one not to boast

Reclining in the saddle
Ready to stretch

Where endless is the open road

Up to the earth he roams
To the sea is his domain
And the land he plows

To the poor and downtrod
They look to him
Who rides with a good heart
And with a pure mind
Proud to serve
The lowly art of walking
Along the path of a life
And blessed are they that know
The path lies smooth as an apple
Though the rough seas they may spill
On a good walk
Keep your conscience clean
And you'll be a saint
This is a path that's not always traveled
Though the paths may be steep
The rewards are worth the drab
They are the streets of Jerusalem
The finest thoroughfares in the entire world
If you break the law or dream the dream
You'll find me on the top of the stairs
Never mind if I'm the last one standing

Where the scoundrels play
With a high-pitched howl
And the knaves grovel

In the brothel of Saint Mark
No one dares to speak ill of him
Or say a word about him
Who, in his right mind,
Would buy such a bauble?
The street of Lazarus
Is pauperized
The stalls are filthy
The crowds are slavering
This is a deep-cover job
The job is a grave one
You'll die beneath the tar
Lie, cheat, or steal
And you'll crawl under
The wheels of fortune
And who will beat you
In a court of mirrors
Who will laugh at you
And grin at you
Demigods have no life
On this mortal coil
You can't lift a soul
With a broken heart
Guts are you?
Bones are you?
Blind men can't see
All you see is darkness
Where the rich and the powerful live
In opulence and luxury
Homes are built upon sand
To a rhythm of ceaseless pounding

All the world is gone but the things I knew.
So much to discover.
I've been living for love but it's a love I can't deny.
All the world is gone but the things I knew.
I've been living for love but it's a love I can't deny.
Living for love has a way of making you forget all about your past.
All the things you tried to hide.
All the things you pulled out.
And then you'd open up your heart and gave it all away.
So much to discover.
I've been living for love but it's a love I can't deny.
All the world is gone but the things I knew.
I've been living for love but it's a love I can't deny.
Living for love has a way of making you forget all about your past.
All the things you tried to hide.
All the things you pulled out.
And then you'd open up your heart and gave it all away.

Innocent until proven guilty
Upon a star-crossed sard
Each guilty of a different crime
Hear the words and the deed
See the face and the face of the past
All hold the secret to long lives
Through hard knocks and easy pegs
All are welcome in our castle
Homes are built for crooks and croakers
Homes are built for thieves and for thievish
Such a cast of dangerous liars
All can claim a hero's crown
Their crimes are reprehensible
They lie and cheat and cheat and steal
From them we receive the crown
Each guilty of a different crime
Hear the words and the deed
See the face and the face of the past
All hold the secret to long lives
Through hard knocks and easy pegs
All are welcome in our castle
Homes are built for crooks and croakers
Homes are built for thieves and for thievish
Such a cast of dangerous liars
All can claim a hero's crown

Imagine someone to love who shares your life with you.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to give you the world to live in.
Imagine someone to love whose eyes are always fixed on yours.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to make you whole.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to take your hand and lead you to believe your dream.
All you have to do is give, and they'll hand you a world you can't even dream of.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to share your life with you.
Imagine someone to love, who cares?
If a world without rules,
Roads without gates,
Are bridges between worlds.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to make you whole.
Imagine someone to love, who'll never be there.
Imagine someone to love who's willing to take your hand and lead you to believe your dream.
All you have to do is give,
And they'll give you the world to live in.

AN:
A world without rules
A world without borders
Can be a world of surprises
Each day
Can be a surprise
Both ways
One is beautiful
And you'll never be quite the same
Never quite the same
Beauty can be found
In every corner
Whether it's rock,
Or paper,
Can be beautiful
As can rock
The sky
The ground
The walls
All can be beautiful
As can rock
A world without rules,
Can be a world of surprises
Every day
Can be a surprise
Both ways
One is beautiful
And you'll never be quite the same
Never quite the same
Beauty can be found
In every corner
Whether it's rock,
Or paper,
Can be beautiful
As can rock
The sky
The ground
The walls
All can be beautiful
As can rock
A world without rules...

TITLE: I am he
Who is he?
Who is he?
Who is he?
We'll set the scene
He's buried with the family
In a shallow grave
Seemed appropriate
Now you tell me
What was he like?
How did you find him?
Did you sneak up on him?
What did you do to him?
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you hear
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you see
And do you see the resemblance?
To be fair, you
Can tell I haven't washed my hair
Not once but twice
Has it ever bothered you?
Does it bother you that I haven't washed my hair?
No, I haven't got a clue
None of it matters
Now's the time
Don't you know
(Don't you know that it's true?) 
There's a kid in your class
You know he's a celebrity
Someone who's in it for the long haul
The rest of your life is secondary
Now's the time
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Who's with me?
Don't you know
(Don't you know that it's true?) 
There's a kid in your class
You know he's a celebrity
Someone who's in it for the long haul
The rest of your life is secondary

You've been to so many places.
From the Arctic to the Sahara.
From the frozen tundra to the raging river.
From the sweltering heat of the city to the shade of the mountains.
You know every inch of me.
All I need is my job back.
It's been years since I was last here.
It hurts my heart to see you go.
But with every day I'm falling deeper into the water.
I want my job back
I want my job back

TITLE: Beauty And The Beast
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

TITLE: I, Daniel Blake
I've always been,
Like a lotus blossom
Deep in the forest
Where a friendly pooch would walk me
And lead me to my own secret world
All my life I've been a prisoner
In a world I shouldn't be
In a world I don't understand
How can I protect me while I walk the plank
Down to the sea I go
And I shudder with fear
How can I be a man
If I can't be a bird
How can I be a dog
How can I be a car
I wanna be a helicopter Pilot
Can I fly?
Can I fly to where the people are?
And be a hero like a hero like me?
The world is calling me
Now it's time to try
I'll carry on flying
I want to make a hero out of you
So you can be a true hero like me
I'll show you the ropes
You'll get through
Now you and I can be a team
And we can fly!
To a place I can fly
And be a hero like a hero like me
