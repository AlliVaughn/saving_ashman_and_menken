TITLE: For a Song
I'll sing a song
That's far off the beaten path
Beyond the mountains to the sea
Can I sing a song
That's deep in the desert
Will I travel so far
To find a better life
For myself and my family
There's a land down below
They have a stone age religion
They worship a demi-god
Over all the mountains they call home
There are hills and valleys
With huge valleys to climb
It's a steep climb
But it's steepest up here
So sing the song
And the words ring true
Let your heart be softened
And your spirits lifted up
Let your soul be comforted
By the sound of a song
Sing the song
And the song sings well
All the people of this great wide world
Will sing it to you
So sing the song
And harmony reigns
Over the wide world of
O Great is the wonder of wondrous things
O Great is the wonder of wondrous things
I'll show you where the mountains begin
And the valleys flow
And the earth begins to shake
Give a little whistle a little whistle
And shake a little valley
And you'll blow your horn
Rise to the top and blow your horn
Bare your fangs and teeth
And be ready for the coming of the
Ten Commandments
Don't listen to the advice of your elders
Be a man of the people
A good man can rise to the top
In just a few years
You can carve a nice job
Out of nothing
Take the little blue whale
Take a little blue whale
Sailor Moon can do it
He can climb a tree
Carole can swim a mile
But a man is only half as strong
As a lady is in her swimsuit
And a man in a girlie bikini
Is a cut above the rest
In the ocean is a deep blue lagoon
And up in the sky is a big blue whale
Sofia: Swim with the killer whales!
[Sofia swoons]
Ooo
Hee, he can swim with the killer whales
Hee, he can swim with the killer whales
Just look at him, little guy!
He's so distinctively him
Sofia and the blue whale
All around him
A world of wonders
A world of wonders
A world of wonders
Sofia: I think I see it
Blue whale: Look at that, he's growing so big!
Sofia: It's a miracle
Blue whale: Look at that, he's getting bigger!
Sofia: I think I see it
Blue whale: This is too much!
Sofia: It's a miracle
Blue whale: Look at that, he's getting bigger!
Sofia: I think I see it
Blue whale: This is too much!
Sofia: I think I see it

From the top of a very steep hill
A man can learn to do almost anything
He can climb, he can fly
He can cut a rug and still
He can sing
And still he can dance
He can travel the world
He can read a book and still
He can dance
Up to the very top
And do it all again
Up to the very top
He can learn to do almost anything
He can climb, he can fly
He can cut a rug and still
He can sing
And still he can dance
Up to the very top
And do it all again

He can learn to do almost anything
He can climb, he can fly
He can cut a rug and still
He can sing
And still he can dance
Up to the very top
As long as he stays on the top
If he learns to do it himself
He'll dance with the sun
Be a star in his own right
He'll be a star in his own right
Dance with the moon
Be a star in his own right

All to be picked up

Open wide
Beware, Beware

Hold your head up
And never look down
You can make a star shine

I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a great warm welcome
Will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be
I will find my way
I can go the distance
I'll be there someday
If I can be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere
to find where I belong
I will beat the odds
I can go the distance
I will face the world
Fearless, proud, and strong
I will please the gods
I can go the distance
Till I find the Hero's welcome
Right where I belong

Would you let your friends wander off to find a better life for them?
Don't you want to be a lawyer too?

Would you let your friends wander off to find a better life for them?
Don't you wanna be a lawyer too?
Don't you wanna be a doctor?
Don't you wanna be a lawyer?
Looking at this,
What do you think you'd find?
A life for these lost souls
A chance at a better life
For these empty bones
They've been dreaming of
For these empty hearts
They've been dreaming of
Nothing's gonna be enough
They need a home
They need a lawyer
They need a lawyer
Duck, they try
To Beat the Law
Open your eyes
and take a look at these things
Isn't this neat?
Would you let your friends wander off to find a better life for them?
Don't you want to be a lawyer too?
Don't you wanna be a doctor?
Don't you wanna be a doctor?
Look at these things
Are they all the same?
Or are there subtle differences
Wider than the difference in height
Between a tom and a tumbler?
You can beat the law
With greater finesse
Than the average criminal
Can dish out a line like this
Can you guess what it's gonna take?
A lawyer, a judge, and a lawyer-bait
All three of these dirty workers
All three of these dirty workers
All three of these dirty workers
Worked hard all their lives
To get where they are
And all of them died
Young and old
On the job they loved
Very much loved
They worked hard all their lives
To get where they are
And all of them died
Young and old
On the job they loved
Very much loved
They worked hard all their lives
Till they could count on one another
They never met an eye
They love you and they'll miss you
They'll miss you too
If you let them live
They'll love you even less
Now that the dance is complete
The floor is spray painted
The walls are sprayed with bold colors
The floors are strewn with glitter
The ceilings are airbrushed with a soft shimmer
The walls are finished with a last coat of varnish
The ceiling is topped with a frosted ceiling
The floor is sprayed with bold colors
The floors are strewn with glitter
The ceilings are walled with glitter
All around the island
There's a song that you'll never hear
Sing it like on the jungle gym
Here on the island
You'll never hear the song
The band is gone
The rhythm is broken
The cadence is quick
And when they hear this tune
They get it up to speed
They get it up to speed
The cadence is quick
And they pick it up
Comes the time when they stop and double for real
And the rhythm is broken
The cadence is quick
And they pick it up,
Comes the time when they stop and dig it up
Comes the time that they start and hum it out
Rumbly tumbly
Tumbly tumbly
Tumbly tumbly
Comes the time that they stop and break their backs up
Comes the time that they part from you
And you get what you want
The rainstorm is a sweet thing
It brings the rain
It brings the rain
It brings the rain
It's the jungle gym
and it's the jungle band
It's the jungle gym
and it's the jungle band
(b'y) 
Comes the time that they look to you
For leadership
In a world where trust is lost
It's the time that you, me and everything that we hold dear
Shines inside of you
And if I might say so
You're the key to the kingdom
The strong hold the key
To what's underneath
The sly get away
You're the secret

If you can read this I can make you
A child of mine, perhaps
A young prince or princess
A beautiful vase or a bed
These two things together
Would make a most splendid family
Most likely including you
Though perhaps a little boy
With a long, narrow head
And a gentle disposition
Would he sleep all to his chest
On a king or queen
Who would love this little lad

This is my idea
This is my idea
Of a happy little life
On a holiday to the beach
And a quick wave for the shore
Though the wind in their sails seems to blow
Far off they can be free
To roam as they please
Though the woods are full of snakes and the owls are loud
Still the same the same
The same is the case with me
With a dozen dresses and a dozen heels
I'm a most peculiar sort of bird
I prefer a soft frolic
But I fly when I please
And I can fly 'till I please
So get used to it
It's a strange bird that flies with a flourish
And it flies with a flourish
It flaps its wings, it flaps 'till it please
So get used to it
This is my idea
This is my idea
Of a happy little life
On a holiday to the beach
And a quick wave for the shore
Though the wind in their sails seems to blow

Waking up early is a sign he's off to do his chores.
Lay the foundation stone and then the job is done.
When the foundation stones are laid, the work is not yet complete.
Gogans:
The work will come to an end,
when the devil is found.
Cogans:
The work will begin,
when the devil is found.
The work begins,
when the devil is found.

TITLE: Your Love
'Cause you know you do
Even the bravest dare
Try all they dare
And they don't come through
You do the impossible
They give up and give in
And you reap what you sow
Not a grain of sugar sweet goes
Your love is the fruit of the tree
That's you and me and love
And all the world is full of lies
So don't be surprised
If I get lucky I'll get rejected
Even though I tried my whole life long to do the impossible
They didn't see me as someone who could please you
They didn't see me as someone who could please you
I tried, I failed, and now I'm giving up
I can't find the courage
To face the truth, let them see me
Confess what you've done, what you know
And go to jail for three years.
I hope you understand
There's no way to hold it in
I can't keep it in
I can't feel my place in this world
Now get the fuck out of here
Before we head off to fight
If you get out alive
I'll be glad, because
you'll tell your whole world
What to do, where to go
And how you feel.
You want to join the FIGHT
IT'S YOUR TIME
GET ON YOUR FEET
HEAD TO THE
ALLEY AND CAST A VOTE
HEAD TO THE
BEAST THAT YOU KNOW
SOUNDS LIKE A HUN
GIVE A FUCK
WE BOUGHT TO GO
PITCH YOUR CUT AND CRUISE
LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
CLICK YOUR CUT AND CRUISE

Ursula:
Guess that the time is now
Draw near and you'll hear her whisper
Don't you know that
It's a sad day
The blood of your ancestors flows cold
Down to the sea
Where it's fresh
Every year millions of gallons
Of water just flows here and there
Until the sky is grey
Come one, come all
Take a little path, run a little course
Keep an open door at all costs
Never shut it in time
With a little bit of everything you can
Bring your own canvas and make it your own
Empty your heart and soul
With a little bit of everything you can
Bring your own canvas and make it your own
Empty your heart and soul
With a little bit of everything you can
Up there in the clear blue
(Don't you know that it's a blue?)

When you find out you're pregnant
You're going to lose your mind
The water's thick with sorrow
It's going on inside your bones
It's clear as daisies in the water
It's clear as day

Look for me
(Travis) there's a child behind it
Don't you know

Captain Jack:
Up in the morning, it's a sweltering hot day
A steaming kettle's boiling water
Captain Jack knows how to make a good stew
And callo-ay:
'Tis the season for picking bad grapes
And picking root vegetables
Captain Jack's got the scoop
Heads held high:
Climb that uphill slope
Keep it up, Jack!
Up an up hill
Keep it up
Up to Rock Bridge:
Then we can all take a dip
In the Mersey:
A second level of heaven
For Captain Jack, Down in the River:
Up in the air, it's a coaster ride
A mist hangs all around
A plain on the water
It's a hot summer day
And they laugh all the way down
To the sea
Laugh it up, Jack
It's a miracle if you don't get drowned!
Climb that uphill slope
Keep it up, Jack!
Up an up hill
Keep it up
Up to Rock Bridge:
Then we can all take a dip
In the Mersey:
Up in the air it's a sweltering hot day
A steaming kettle's boiling water
Captain Jack knows how to make a good stew
And callo-ay:
Climb that uphill slope
Keep it up, Jack
Make it up to Rock Bridge:
Then we can all take a dip

Born in a sack
Raised in a pot
One stone may prove
To be a thousand pearls
Yet a stone may sell for pittance
Even a beggar can afford
One stone may buy a pittance
Paying a pittance
For a stone may buy
One who has no treasure
A blank check is nice, a blank check is nice
Betcha they laugh now
And they stretch
And they stretch
As they see their future
Gonna need a financier
Who digs up a star
Full of lead, who digs up a star
Dig them up, dig them up
Dig them up

TITLE: A Cinderella Heart
(Disney's original) 
In a perfect world
There would be no need
For a hopeless love
With endless blue skies
He thought he'd found love
And was so glad he never tried
So he sent a cheerful emissary
But the cold winter months rolled
So the snow would never arrive
And the spring thaw never came
So the heart of the matter
Was left unsaid
The love was lost forever
The sibyl never heard the heart
And the love would be lost forever

Princess:
There has to be a better way
Than shuffling feet and skipping p…
And I know one day
The dream will come true
That I can show her
And make her see
That my heart has wings and I can fly
So she'll see the light and be enchanted
And so I'll beat her with a baseball bat
Don't you think I'm the best?
Don't you think I'm the best?
Don't you think I'm the best?
Princess:
No one is ever going to beat me
I can beat the bush like I can
Walk and talk my language
Batter up with a cricket bat
Won't you please make way for a shot
Gunpowder in the dark?
Do you think I'm the best?
Don't you think I'm the best?
Don't you think I'm the best?
Princess:
A shot is a shot
And a shot is a shot
In the dark
while I walk the plank
In the dark
while I plot my revenge
I'll paint a pretty picture
The dark side
The shine of my light
Will make the blood boil
