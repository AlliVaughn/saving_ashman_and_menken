Wreck-It Ralph is a giant of a man
Nine feet tall with really big hands
Living in a stump on his very own land
Until his world went crazy
Riding a coot
While he blew dandelion fuzz
In a car accident that killed him
Three pieces of his dream germane
He built himself a shrine
Just waiting to be unearthed
And then he got in a big hurry
And won't you look at that
He's on his way to being forgotten
Now he's got a couple of strikes against him
Not the least bit inclined to give them another chance
Wreck-It Ralph is a schemer
Not the sort who sticks to his guns
Riches for Robespierre
And he's got a lot to teach
The rest of us don't get much
Riches for Robespierre
I'm giving him a chance
So he may as well give it everything he has
Riches for Robespierre
I'm giving him a chance
I'm giving him a chance
He could just use a little tuppence
In his pocket
To buy him some time
While he plays victim
And plots his revenge
Wreck-It Ralph is a schemer
Not the sort who sticks to his guns
Riches for Robespierre
And he's got a lot to teach
The rest of us don't get much
Riches for Robespierre
I'm giving him a chance
So he may as well give it everything he has
Riches for Robespierre
I'm giving him a chance
I'm giving him a chance
He could just use a little tuppence in his pocket
In his hand
While he's cussing and fuming
Over a guy named Pierre
Who stole their thunder
From him
Condemned to a life of servitude
They'll see what happens
When he gets hungry on the job
They'll see what happens when you don't
Stop him
And Jack will make him pay
Stand your ground
C'mon
Riches for Robespierre
Jack said, "We'll give him a chance."
I said, "We'll set him free."
The old man said, "We'll give him another chance."
Well, I suppose I have a conscience
And I say to you, "No, we won't."
We won't let him get away with this heist
We won't let him get away with this heist
No, he won't!

For reaching for my dreams
To hold on

And will understand
That sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
To move on and
Take it slow
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
Just trust my gut
The past is past

When it comes to dreams
I prefer a hot knife
To a cold one
You'll have
To put your faith in what you trusting in me
Just trust me
Till my dreams come true

And The saints to keep us all safe
So hungry for him

We'll happily eat him up

You can bet the guys at work will say "go get your hands of him"

Any boy under the sun will feel a twinge of fear
Just like a shot through the heart
When the full force of the storm is near
And all the dreams that we dream are reality
Just like a shot through the heart
In the nick of time
In the nick of time
In the nick of time
The sun will come out, set, and then return
The day as we know it
Will be gone
The sun
Will be here
When it calls me
Just remember, dear, the sun will be here
In the sky
Just know that the day is gone
And the sun
Will be here
Just as always

TITLE: Taste The Light
When the world goes wrong, I can always turn to you
For help, when the world seems lost, turn to me
And I'll be there, to finish the job, once and for all
You can call me a genius, but the only thing that comes to mind is
Why should I waste my time, your time, your time on somebody else?
Well, look at me, I'm trying to get by
Not by myself, but with you
I must admit, I've got problems
And you know they're all my fault, but still
I wish that I could be you
And I'd be so much happier if I could be you too
I'm falling so hard for you, I can't believe my luck
And I can't believe that you even care
I'd have finished my journey, and started again
If it weren't for you
I wouldn't even know where to go
My mind is elsewhere, I should probably go back home
To my real life, where I belong
I can't go back, to the way I used to know
Oh, to the happy place, I must go
Home, to my real life, where I belong
There's nothing there, it all goes on
The same old things, the same old people, the same old things
The sun, the sky, the sea, they all stay the same
No, I won't miss them one bit, I gotta move on
And I'll move on, as well, if you're not with me now
Are you with me now?
I'm not with you
I can't believe my luck, I gotta move on
And I'll move on, as well, if you're not with me now
Are you with me now?
I'm not with you
So I turn away, afraid to face the light
It's like there's no one there, waiting for me
To come back, to who I was, waiting to hear my voice
I look in my future, and wonder what I'd have to go through
Now I know what my future holds
And I know that you're there, waiting for me
To learn, to trust, to belong
I turn away, afraid to face the light
It's like there's no one there, waiting for me
To come back, to who I was, waiting to hear my voice
I look in my future, and wonder what I'd have to go through
Now I know what my future holds
And I know that you're there, waiting for me
To learn, to trust, to belong
I turn away, afraid to face the light
It's like there's no one there, waiting for me
To learn, to trust, to belong
I turn away, afraid to face the light

Bert:
Every morning before dawn,
All of us climb to the top of the mountain,
And there forked in front of us,
A pair of crooked teeth,
A beak for a tail,
A beak for a grub.
It's a vicious cycle,
Which we can break,
Break it in half,
And then,
Rein in the fangs.
It's true,
It's a very efficient way of eating.
Grub,
Grub,
Grub,
In the best tradition of Southern cooking,
We gratefully accept.
To the plate,
Or,
To the cup,
We give thanks for the joy we've all had,
In the company of friends like us.
Yes, friends like us.
We're your dinner,
Your supper,
Our speciality.
Come on and sample,
Sake,
Beef,
Pork,
Chicken,
Grub,
Fish,
And,
Wine,
Here we go in the sauce.
Mmm,
We hardly need to mention,
The wonderful people we've met,
When describing our speciality.
Oh, our speciality.
It's al dente,
Mmm, our speciality.
It's al dente,
Mmm, our speciality.
It's al dente,
Mmm, our speciality.
It's al dente,
Mmm, our speciality.
Bert:
We never use the word "quasi"
When referring to you, Mr. Aladdin!
In fact, we hardly need to say it,
Because you're so extraordinary.
Your temper is so great,
You're our only friend.
No, really, thanks.
Everyone:
You're welcome!
For the most part,
We take al dente,
To mean "for the most part."
But there are occasions,
When you disappoint us,
We cut you down to size.
And then,
You step in our laps!
All:
You're welcome!
For the most part,
We take al dente to mean "for the most part."
But there are occasions,
When you disappoint us,
We cut you down to size.
And then,
You step in our laps!
Aladdin:
So you think you can replace me,
Dammit!
You think you can change me,
Not my taste!
All:
You're welcome!
For the most part,
We take al dente to mean "for the most part."
But there are occasions,
When you disappoint us,
We cut you down to size.
And then,
You step in our laps!
Yes, sir, we'll be supporting you,
No, shit!
You're helping us out,
Giving us al dente,
To mean "for the most part."
But there are occasions,
When you disappoint us,
We cut you down to size.
And then,
You step in our laps!
Dammit!
All:
You're welcome!

Cornelius:
Let me be your wings
Let me be your only love
Every step you take
All the days and years
They'll be yours for ever
Singing a love song to me
I will take you far beyond the stars
Through endless space
I'll hold you as dear
As my own family
Through the darkest hour
I'll be there beside you
Singing a love song to you
I will take you far beyond the skies
Through endless time
Through endless love

And I could live
As happy as dogs
As you see
On a summer's morning
And the sky was clear
As clear as the dog bowl
As bright as the dog bowl
(Instrumental interlude) 
Tiger Woods ew
Pete Sampras ew
Woods and bags of rice
That's all
I'd throw them all away
If I could live
As happy as dogs
As you see
On a summer's morning
And the sky was clear
As clear as the dog bowl
As bright as the dog bowl

TITLE: I've Got a Dream
Hook Hand Thug:
I'm malicious, mean and scary!
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest...
But despite my evil look
And my temper
And my hook!
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.
Can you see me on the stage performing Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'till they gleam
Yes, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley!
'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream!
To be a concert pianist
On a big, stupid stage!
With a big ol' fat bass!
'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream!
To be a concert pianist
On a big ol' fat bass!
Can you see me on the stage playing Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam
Yes, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley!
'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream!

TITLE: Perfect World
The perfect world
Is here for you now
You can find it in perfect harmony
Between two
Depend on each other
To realize your potential
You must learn to love each other unconditionally
Every moment you are here with me
Lives and memories
Of the loving embraces
That you've received
From all around the world
There is beauty and there is suffering
And we all pay for understanding
When we lose hope, or when we run into trouble
We learn to love each other
Always we'll find a way
To find our place in the perfect world
You and I
And all of those around us
Are meant to be
Guided by our shared history
We learn to love each other
Always we'll find a way
To find our place in the perfect world
