TITLE: The Best Of Both Worlds
If you want to leave a bad situation, to the bad guy, who would you prefer be?
Good, old-fashioned good-guy action
You don't mess around 'till the cows come home
And the old man who runs the place is thirsty
And the old woman who carries his groceries
Want a fight they can understand
And if they don't complain, our servers will
Make them pay, and then maybe they'll learn to be grateful
And finally, at last, someone to whom they can truly relate
And who will reward good behavior
And bring back the good times
The best of both worlds

====================
TITLE: Love
You're so precious to me
I feel so alive just hearing your voice
So peaceful and beautiful around me
I should write a song
But I'm too shy to speak up
You know I've never felt before
Someone as loving and understanding
As you are
You're the only one I should love
You're the only one I should love

TITLE: One Less Ride
One Less Ride
(Justin Timberlake) 
One Less Ride
Like a river
Never ends
Like a lake
One Less Ride
Home where my heart is
One Less Ride
Like a river
Never ends
Like a lake

TITLE: Give A Little Whistle
(Jimmy Fallon) 
Every little thing you do
You do it because you love to do it
And when you're nervous
(Phyllis Smith) 
And you don't know how to do it
Give a little whistle and a little wave and
let's all sing it together
Give a little whistle and a little wave
and when you're in trouble
(Clopin) 
And you can't hear your song
the old fashioned way
Listen to your song
The song that you want to sing
And when your song starts to sound a little familiar
It's when you're backing up
And you look back and see what you missed
And you're making the most of every minute you're getting closer and closer each and every day
and you're so grateful to everybody
That you don't feel so down
You don't have to feel so down
You don't have to face those dark days
That you used to know
When you ring the bell
And your life is on the road
Don't waste another minute
That you could be wasting
When you're backing up
And you're feeling so down
You're a favorite parlor trick
And you know every single turn of the crank
Or the hair on the back of your neck
Is a sign that your days are coming
Gonna' be alright you don't have to feel so down

====================
TITLE: I've Got a Dream
I've got a dream
Just imagine how much bigger the world will be
I'll be a-chorus
Just imagine how much more interesting life will be
I'm sure that when I wake up in the morning
my thoughts will not stray from the things that I have seen
Just imagine how much more interesting life will be
I've got a dream
Like no other dream
I've got a dream
But it�s not a dream
Like no other dream
I've got a dream
What I've got a dream
Like no other dream
I've got a dream
But it�s bigger than life and it�s better than life
I've got a dream
So why should I quit my job right away?
�Cause life is short and sweet
And because it�s painful to give up
And because it�s the truth
And because it�s painful to give up
I've got a dream
But I've got a dream
And I've got a dream
And I've got a dream
And I've got a dream
And I've got a dream
And I've got a dream
Which one of these two�s yours?
My brain�s a-flutter
I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream
But my heart is also a-flutter
And I've got a dream

====================
TITLE: I'm Allergic to Rainbows
I've got a dream
Rainbows come out of nowhere
And shiver me timon and oh
And shiver me timon and oh
Picking up on a feeling
Like a switch has been pulled
The night must have a strange rhythm
Started out as a song
Now I'm falling asleep
Shh!
The pounding of the drums
The joy of creating
Things my little friend Lucina would understand
These are signs that the time has come for me to let go
And to show her I'm allergic to rainbows

====================
TITLE: If I Never Knew You
If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be
And if I never knew you
I would never have known
That this perfect world I see
Is a dream
And if I never knew you
I'd be bereft without you
I am so child-like
I could be a killer
I am falling so fast for you
And if I never knew you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find peace
And if I never knew you
I'd be so lost in the night
You're calling my name
And I'm so blindsided and moved by your kiss
I don't know who to be
My heart starts beating again
I can feel that your love is real
And this world can start to heal
If I never knew you
I'd have no inkling of
If I never knew you
I'd be so blindsided and moved by your kiss
I don't know who to be
My heart starts beating again
I can feel that your love is real
And this world can start to heal
If I never knew you
I thought our love would be so beautiful
And so true
And if I never knew you
I'd be so lost in the night
You're calling my name
And I'm so blindsided and, so, so
So blindsided and, so, so
So blindsided

TITLE: Happy Together
What's the matter with you?
It's not that I'm bitter.
It's not that I'm bitter.
It's not that I'm bitter.
But something's different this time.
The sounds we make,
The way we speak,
The way we walk.
It's almost as though we're not really there at all.
And if you weren't here,
Would you see what I'm seeing?
Would you know what it's like to lose your mind?
For one so brief a time?
I'll never know what it's like to lose your mind.
And if I never knew what it's like to lose your mind,
How could I ever know what it's like to lose your mind?
And if I never knew what it's like to lose your mind,
How could I ever know what it's like to lose your mind?

TITLE: The Power Of Love
Imagine someone to love who loves you back.
Imagine all of those precious days when you and I were truly one.
Imagine how wonderfully the sun would shine on those days we spent together.
Imagine how wonderful life would be if someone to love, found us.

TITLE: I'm a dancer in need of a dance partner
Someone who can join me on the floor
In a dancing position with my feet firmly planted
In a loving embrace by the side of the road
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer in need of a dance partner
Though I've spent most of my life confined to the floor
I feel a new love every time I step out of the house
The smile that greets me on the street
Is the happiest I've ever seen
And though I hardly believe it, I'm beginning to believe it
In a loving embrace by the side of the road
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer in need of a dance partner
Though I've spent most of my life confined to the floor
I feel a new love every time I step out of the house
The smile that greets me on the street
Is the happiest I've ever seen
And though I hardly believe it, I'm beginning to believe it

TITLE: Cancun
City on the Hill
The city of cancUNCUNC!
The people united as one!
The houses on the one and only stilts!
The street is lined with the happy and the foolhardy.
The clever use of the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki.
The tongue holds no contempt for size or measure.
It wants only the wondrous things it learns.
It wants them all, and more, and when it learns, it does so with gusto.
It's a wondrous place, and I wish to share it with you.
You'll find the city on the hill,
In the city of cancUNCUNC.

TITLE: Let the Music Sing
Let the music sing
let the music sing
let the music sing
let the music sing
Fall in love and leave the world behind
for a time in your heart will be like home
alone
Your happiness will come to you
When you find your world wide apart
and there is no one to ring bells and wind the tree
bells of New England
Then maybe your heart will begin a song
the words of a child who has lost his/her way
The words of a song that is too long to understand
and too true to be babbled back

====================
TITLE: Dandelion
i hear a really weird sound, like an explosion

but when i hear that aere's my birthday, and its the night that i learned that aere's my birthday

TITLE: The Spirit Of Our Times
We have but one fate to dread
And that is the wrath of God
Begging us to repent
And to join his joy
We have but one fate to fear
And that is the sword of the Spirit
Bring it on and join the fray
(We have but one fate) 
So raise up the sword and join the fray
(We have but one fate) 
And join the fray like brothers we were meant to be
(We have but one fate) 
So raise up the sword and join the fray
(We have but one fate) 
And join the fray like brothers we were meant to be

TITLE: A Hero's Tale
In a perfect world
There is no need for fear
In a world of my own
I would play hero
Just to get the drop on the bad guy
In a world without fear
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly!
Soar
I can fly!
SCREAM!
I can fly!
SCREAM!
I can fly!
And when the world goes wrong
I can fly back into it again
I can fly back into it again!
And when the world goes wrong
I can fly right back into it
I can fly right back into it

====================
TITLE: The End Is Near
The sun will rise,
The beginning the second day.
And the feeling of the sea will wash away all memory of shore.
And for once, at least, we'll walk side by side.
As the sun begins to rise,
And the tide begins to roll,
We'll meet again at the beginning,
Where it all began—at Last!

====================
TITLE: When Someone Loved Me
when someone loved me
love can come to those who love
love comes to those who love
someone looked at me,
thought I was a dreamer,
someone held me,
held me as a child does
love is an ever-changing emotion
love's no-denouement
love's no-excuse
to skip a beat,
to flip a switch,
to turn away the time-honored
paths of love
when someone loved me

====================
TITLE: You Don't Know Jack
You've been looking in vain
for someone who's mysterious and bright
but who's also cold and serious
you don't know jack and if you don't know jack
you're missing an ace up your sleeve
you don't know jack and if you don't know jack
you're trusting an idiot
you don't know jack and if you don't know jack
you're dead! dead!
You don't know jack's a cruel and mysterious fellow
who'll send you on a wicked spree
You don't know jack's a vicious and deformed fellow
who'll make you serve his whim
You don't know jack's a lie and a ruse
who'll make you do as he says
You don't know jack's a trickster and a con
who'll put your faith in an unshakable delusion
You don't know jack's a knave and a betrayer
who'll steal and cheat you again and again and again
You don't know jack's a knave and a betrayer
YEAH!

TITLE: Your World
Open your eyes
Take a look inside
Shining shoes on the shelf
No one's watching
No one's judging
I'm alone but I can see right through you
(Chorus) 
Open your eyes
Take a look inside
What's the matter with you?
Someone's turning into me
You don't know who or what to think
Fear and doubt run rampant
You don't know where to turn
I can see the truth all around you
And if the world is cruel and you're being punished
It doesn't matter now
What's the matter with you?
And the people I love
They understand
That they have a world they need of their own
And they're right there waiting to hear you cry
Open your eyes
Take a look inside
What's the matter with you?
Someone's turning into me
You don't know who
Or what to do
And the time is drawing near now
It seems like only yesterday
You and I were barely alive
And I'm feeling the burn
It's so hard to believe
All that you'll want to do is run away
But there's no time like the present
And all that you can do is stand still
Keep screaming and frolicking and frolicking
And let your freak flag fly
You don't know where to turn
And the world is still letting you in
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the world is still letting you in
Oh, oh, oh, oh

TITLE: I'm Your Worst Enemy
Writer: Noah Baumbach
Stars: Jennifer Lawrence, Joel Edgerton, Toby Jones
As the world goes wrong for you
I get the urge to do just about anything
To make it right, no matter the cost
I get the urge to give a fighting chance
to anyone who will listen
Everyone wants to know, do I have a heart?
Will you still be with me when the fighting's done?
Will your heart still be here for me?
If I let you down tonight can you make it all right?
I'm your worst enemy
I don't want your forgiveness
I want your hatred
I want your contempt
I want your scorn
And all it takes is one tiny mistake
to bring you down
I want your head and I want your heart
I want avenge
I want a holy war
I want to see your face
And know that my crusade will be victorious
I want a holy war
I want to see your face
And know that my crusade will be victorious
I want a holy war
I want to see your face
I want a holy war
I want to see your face

TITLE: Where's Waldo?
Waldo, how are ya?
Come on, you little termite.
Write something down.
You don't know what you're about to say.
And don't try to hide what you've done.
It's all just too much!
You're gonna let it go, won't you?
Here goes nothing...
...and as the days go by
nothing stays the same.
A new day, a new start.
Nothing to fear, nothing to wish.
And as the weeks go by
nothing stays the same.
Slowly but surely, things will turn around.
The past, the present and the future are all the same.
The only difference is who's to blame.
Your time is running out.
Get with the times, get with the times.
Get with the times, now!

TITLE: You've Got A Friend In Me (Joe Jackson)
You've got a friend in me
All of your dreams come true
When you think you can't, you'll find you can
And the only regret
Is the one you don't take
And the only way to end it
Is to let the light shine on you
And the only way to know you
Are you're watching over me
So we don't have to be
And when your time has come to step aside
You can still walk in my shoes
You've got a friend in me
All of your dreams come true
When you think you can't, you'll find you can
And the only regret
Is the one you don't take
And the only way to end it
Is to let the light shine on you
And the only way to know you're watching over me
So we don't have to be
And when your time has come to step aside
You can still walk in my shoes
You've got a friend in me
All of your dreams come true
When you think you can't, you'll find you can
And the only regret
Is the one you don't take
And the only way to end it
Is to let the light shine on you
And the only way to know you're watching over me
...Yeah

TITLE: New World Bound
The old world is calling me
Can your children not see
The land they see is not for them
And the world they see is not for me
And the visions they see are not for me
And my people are not safe here
They are hungry and they are cold
And there is not enough for them
So they are asking now, what is the meaning of this
Little island they find themselves on
Why do they go there?
To seek a better life for their kind
But the island they find on the ocean floor
Is not a home
It is a world of sorrow
Where the little island they call home
Is not a home
They will not be safe here
And they will not survive
They are strangers yet untied
From the sea they cry and shout and wave their arms
And this is the beginning
Of a new life for these children of the new world
The island they find on the ocean floor
Is not a home
It is a world of sorrow
Where the little island they call home
Is not a home
They will not be safe here
And they will not survive
They are strangers yet untied
From the sea they cry and shout and wave their arms
And this is the beginning
Of a new life for these children of the new world

One heart like the sand
Dousing the caves
With hot coals

Our beliefs
Our history
Straight away
From the stone age
One by one
We will become one
Family clump
We are one
