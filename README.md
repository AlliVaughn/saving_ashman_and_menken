## What are you using Machine Learning for? 
---------------------------------------------
Like so many celebrated Disney Lyracists, Howard was extremely overworked and  woefully underpaid!(Kidding!) He passed away in the 1990's but his long-time partner Alan Menken still misses him. Together, they were resposible for some pretty iconic Disney soundtracks. What if Alan could have a version of his old partner back again?  </br>
Together they wrote Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. Menken went on to write Pocahontas, Newsies, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Home on the Range, Enchanted, and Tangled, among others.
Alan is hoping that AI will help him knock out some new hit Disney songs with Howard's old lyrics flair. 


## **What we are aiming for:** 
**Metrics:** Menken once said that his songs should be hummable, meaning catchy, and Ashman was a playwright that also thought that they should sound natural, so that's what we are aiming for!  
</br> 
Our resuslts will pit two Disney songs against one another and you will choose which was written by Ashman and which was not so that Alan can decide if he'd like his old partner back as an AI.
