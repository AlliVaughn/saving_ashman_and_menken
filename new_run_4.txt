I would find my place
And found my world
In a world of my own

And know for sure that wherever I went
I would find my place

TITLE: When We Were Kings
When we were kings
The dashing and sultry scent of Paris
And the quote "Tie la la la la la"
When we were kings
There was wine to be had
And not a sniff to be sniffed
We had sex to taste
And not a sniff to be sniffed
The roses to sip
And not a sniff to be sniffed
Around the chamber of the one true king

How to be human, can mean so much.
I want to share my journey with you
so you can feel safe,
so you can find your place in the sun.
I want to share this love with you
so that you will feel like a part of who I am.
I want to show you, everyone, that you are never alone.

I want to make you feel like a princess,
so that when I say I want to be you, I really mean it.
I want to make you feel like a princess,
I want you to dress like a princess,
and when I say I want to be a princess, I really mean it.

====================
TITLE: Let Me Be Your Wings
Here I stand, alone and wide-eyed
In a burning building full of fire
Never dreaming why
All my dreams are like stars in the sky
Now here I stand, holding the sword in my fist
And the voice inside sings a song
Of fear and anger and love
And trust and kinship
And all it takes is one syllable
To say...
Let me be your wings
Have you ever heard the wolf cry?
Or asked the smiling cow for milk
Or asked a dumbbells-n'-tenpenny how many pounds
You can carry?
Because if you haven't, you're a fool
and a foolhardyette
you should learn to be a fool
-- Robin Williams

TITLE: What's The Matter With My Brain
What's the matter with my brain?
It gets a little freaky
People putting candles on it
But I never see the light
Cause I'm so dorked out
I'm thinking about things I want to
Hoover up
But I don't have time for that
I've got to get up
What's the matter with my brain?
And everytime I look around I see
What's the matter with the world?
Everything is so unfamiliar
And the things they say make no sense
And the things that I read make me feel like a fool
But I'll keep going because I must
What's the matter with my brain?
And everytime I look around I see

But I'll keep going because I must

====================
TITLE: I'm Nobody
Everybody knows me
I never change
I'm a nobody
Nobody to speak of
My name is Holloway
But people speak of me
As the sheen of the sea
The tide, how it ebbs and flows
The grasses, the roots and the leaves
All tell of a lost time
And that time has come for me to claim the day
nobody knows me
But a dear friend of mine
says my name is Holloway
And my heart is as true as the ocean
And if the sun's straight on me
All the world will smile upon me
I'm somebody gone but not forgotten
I'm nobody
But people still call me
And little-known
And some people still love me
And some people still love me
I'm nobody but people call me
And I'm sailing away from her who knows me
Far from the bitter past
I'm sailing away from her who knows me
Far from the world I knew
I'm somebody gone but not forgotten
I'm somebody gone but not forgotten
I'm somebody missing but not forgotten
I'm somebody new but not forgotten

====================
TITLE: Fashions
(Verse 1) 
From Little Mermaid
There's a time when all the little merfolk
Were made of one big house
And if you'll forgive me I can't wait
Just for you to see
Inside this house I'm sure
There's a wonderful place
I wouldn't wish for
But I've been such a fool
There's a mystery about this place
I can't put my finger on
But someone's always getting whisked away
There's a gleam in her eyes that's not right
Something's familiar about her, unknown to me
(Chorus) 
From Tinkerbell
With a hunch and a nudge
We found a way to get to the bottom of things
It's stranger than fiction
She's like a bell that doesn't ring
She's like a clock that doesn't show
She's like a dog that doesn't bark
She's like a cat that doesn't hunt
She's like a fairy that doesn't make
Any sound that she makes is part of her music
And she'll play it again and again
Because she's Fashions
The Bells of Fashions

====================
TITLE: A girl in red
A girl in red
What she wears, what she eats
That's her prerogative
But now that she's here
It's her turn
And it's hers to claim
Though the world may not know
Oh, she's a mysterious girl
Who's off to a good start
Though her heart is elsewhere
It's glitter and sparkle and ooh-ah
She's a very pretty girl
And the world will find her
Though her heart is elsewhere
It's glitter and sparkle and ooh-ah

====================
TITLE: Hell Sentence
She's an ugly demon
Making off with children's toys
And they're all scared
So you can read her mind
And guess what she's going to do
She's going to do what she does
She's going to do what she does...

'cause way down deep inside me out of all control
chorus:

my mother who loves me
and holds me safe and sound
the sea is my mother

TITLE: You Make the Dance (Feat D-tent Boys)
You make the dance, and the time is finally here
To take our dance from memory
Back when we was young
There was a time when we all shared
The world was our home and it felt so good
When you moved from being a slave to a freess
Everything was new and wonderful
And every moment was exciting
So let's get it up to rated
You make the dance and the time is now
To bring it on home

====================
TITLE: A Girl Worth Fighting For
There are things in life you'll never understand
A girl worth fighting for
A girl you can never see
A voice inside singing words
Things you can't understand
If you're lost in the storm
Find somewhere safe and sound
And learn to love the night
It will bring you strength
It will bring you security
It will bring you home
A girl worth fighting for
A girl you can never see
A voice inside singing words
Things you can't understand
If you're lost in the storm
Find somewhere safe and sound
And learn to love the night
It will bring you strength
It will bring you security
It will bring you home

TITLE: A Man For All Time

====================
TITLE: The Gospel Truth Tell'n'Tell
The Gospel Truth Tell'n'Tell'n'Tell us about the money we're given,
And how it's all made right,
When we believe, and come back to you
So don't waste time on talkin' about money,
That's the heart of the matter,
The true matter,
The one that nobody knows.
And the sinner knows,
But how to find out what's true?
It's the same as the blind man finds his way home,
And the wife that's fled,
While the lover's lost and found,
While the world goes crazy.
And all the while, he's dreamin' about the night he found it,
And the one he knew that she knew
And the love that he's never known.
And all the while, he's dreamin' about the night that he found it,
And the one he knew that she knew
And the love that he's never known.
And all the while, he's dreamin' about the night he found it,
And the one he knew that she knew.

TITLE: The Story So Far
(Selena Gomez & Sofia Carson) 
Ain't it glorious day
When I woke up this morning, it was sunny and nice
And I'm glad I didn't throw in the towel
When it seemed like the days were numbered
I had to get up, get right, and make the most of my lucky day
Well, well, well, well
The bad guys had a strong army
They were bigger than life, and I'm glad I played along
Because the good guys were nowhere to be found
I was too afraid to give chase
And too ashamed to try
So I made the most of my lucky day
And went for broke trying to be brave
And maybe others will learn from my mistake
And don't do the things I did last night
(Ain't it glorious day) 
The good guys are nowhere to be found
The worst of the worst are too afraid to come forward
And the only ones who learned last night are me and you
So maybe some things, last night, will seem familiar
And maybe some of last night's memories will prove true
Still others may not be so lucky
This mother, that daughter, you all know each other
And maybe someday, these things will become part of who we are
You and I, we've come so far together
And maybe someday, these things will become part of who we are
One step at a time, one dream at a time
One hope, one prayer
We've made one step at a time, one dream at a time
And maybe someday, these things will become part of who we are

====================
TITLE: The Day I, met your father
was the happiest day of my life
my father gave me a big hug and a big kiss
and then he took me to the races
and back again without fail
I will never forget his sweet but stern cry
"not the kind you hear every day
but daddy you know that feeling well
nowy day that you met your father oh

====================
TITLE: The First Time
I remember the first time I met you
You were just a dim, timid little thing
I remember the cold snap of your laughter
And the shame that clung to me
And I knew for a time that you were right, that you were both mistaken
For everything that had happened the night before
I see the way you're gazing at me now
And I see the way they'd tried to stand
By my side, fooling themselves that I wasn't going to see you
And the way they'd tried to understand
That this old, worn-out idea was just a nightmare
And that maybe, just maybe, this baby could be real
The dream that I'd had all along
Was about to come true
You're standing there, impossibly tall
And I can't believe it's true
When you come over the hill you'll be sure to be remembered
And the way you stood there, impossibly tall
I remember the first time I met you
You were just a dim, shy, timid little thing
I remember the fire in your eyes
And the pity in your voice
And the shame that I still carry
I remember the cold snap that hit me
The shame that clung so hard
And the shame that still does
I can't believe it's true
When you come over the hill you'll be sure to be remembered
And the way you stood there, impossibly tall
And I can't believe it's true
When you come over the hill you'll be sure to be remembered
And the way you stood there, impossibly tall
I see the way you're gazing at me now
And I see the way they'd tried to stand by my side
As a boy did
As a boy would
As a boy would

====================
TITLE: The Bare Necessities
I've been around the block before
Stood in the back and avoided being hit
'Cause I've got something I learned from 'em.
The bare nessesities.
Like getting up in the morning and straightening up
'Cause those simple bare nessesities
Reduce stress and increase energy
And when you're stressed, it's great relief
To know that your energy levels will return to normal once you start bare nessing.
Once a week I'll double up as a lab rat
And I'll stick it out as long as I can
Because I've got something I learned from 'em.
The bare nessesities.
Like getting up in the morning and straightening up

And I'll stick it out as long as I can

TITLE: Call Me
What would your world be like without me?
Everything changes.
How will you know me?
Will you come to me?
Will you take my hand?
It's dark and stormy outside and it's hot and dry inside.
But it's all so new, can't you see how it all fits together?
The world is strange, unexpected, and wonderful, and I just know it.
And I'm just a phone call away, can you hear me?
And I just don't know who or what I'm supposed to be.
And if I find who and if it's true, then everything will be right.
And if I don't, then the sky will be grey and the sea walls will crumble.
And as the nights roll in, can you watch me?
And if they're cold, they just melt.
And if they're hot, they're both so refreshing.
And if I can learn to do it, then I can learn to do it.
And if I can learn to do it, then I'll know that I have to do it.
And if I can learn to do it, then I'll know that I have to do it.

TITLE: Goodbye (Aaliyah) 
Goodbye, goodbye, good night
You don't have to leave me
You don't have to go
You don't have to stay away
I know you're thinking the same thing I'm thinking
And you're right, it's lonely near the end
And nobody knows when
The love you showed me
Was just as good as you left me
I think it's time you started thinking the same way I was thinking
And leaving you won't bring me home
It won't bring me to you
It won't bring me to you

TITLE: The Gospel Truth Iiiiii
Tell me, little one, did the world go to--
[Stories begin]
The world was bad, the world was bad.
Every single thing they did was wrong.
And if I ll learn, they did it all for me.
But when I get to know someone new,
Who will protect me from--
The world will be a mystery.
But when I get to know someone new,
Will they be there to protect me?

====================
TITLE: Stereo Vision (Reprise)
You said that you were in love
And I thought you were in love
But when I started to drift apart
You started to come back into my life
And when we kissed you said that you loved me too
And I started to see the world differently
You started to come back into my life too
And when we laughed and cried and loved each other
We both knew that love was
The way that you looked at me
And I started to see the world differently
You started to come back into my life too
And when we looked in each other's eyes and smiled
We both knew that love is beautiful too
And that love is powerful and true
And that love can bring us together
And that love is beautiful, sweet and mysterious
All at once we became one
You and I
And that's how you know that love is beautiful
We are one
Because you love me
I will be safe and secure
Because you love me
You'll bring me a home
I can make you proud
Because you love me
