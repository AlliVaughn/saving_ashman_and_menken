(Future with Din) 
What if I told you...
Future with Din
She'll never be with me
Past is a memory
And with the time that passes
Will the things that we do
Have meaning?
Or is it all a dream?
I try to picture me and Future
But it's impossible to capture
The timbre of Future's breath
The swells of aching heart
Are a warning
Keep your head down
and follow the path of the past
Past is a memory
and with the time that passes
Will the things that we do
Have meaning?
Or is it all a dream?
Past is a memory...

Do we want to go now?
No, we don't want to go anywhere
At least not yet

Take a dirt nap
Wake up in the jungle
And be a man
The hard way
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Just as good as them
(angry hyenas) 
What they lack in strength
They make up for in guile
Courageousness, loyalty
Daring acts, resolute
These are the ways to a warrior's heart

Me and you once again.
I go outside my window and you stay inside.
Like the rain and the snow. You never see me down there.
But I know of a star like no one else.
In the hearts and souls of men we have connected.
I will find him. I will reach him.
And we'll make him proud.
Like no one else.
In the hearts and souls of men we have connected.
I will find him. I will reach him.
And we'll make him proud.
Nora:
thats an understatement
i'll be laying in bed
until my thoughts begin to fade
from the visions that I see
and the stories that I hear
there will be a break for the rain
and the sun will shine on the land
down to the sea we will roam
lives and times when the sea was calm
and I was king of the hills
Just think how far we'd go!
Chorus:We will slay the dragon
And restore the balance
To the river bank
The sea will be calm
As the flood-waters recede
And the hills will crest
We will slay the dragon
And bring back the balance
To the river bank

There's a reason we keep forgetting the past and the time we shared

Past and future
Till a fence can't keep them

Hope springs and future meets us
In a ring of fencers for the thrill
A fool could break his back
And still fight
To try and be a joker

A fighter's spirit is a sign of power
Athletic prowess is a sign of respect
Fighters never die
They fight to the bitter end
When the bright stars shine
On the horizon
There's a dream

It's our time
Now it's time to kick some ass
This is my plan
This is how it's going to be
Hey, you all here to kick some ass
Together we can!
Crazy way we're going
Kick some ass!
We're going on a tear
Spin it's out!
Take it from me,
We can!
Kicking some ass!
Through the roof!
Crazy way we're going
Shout it out!
We're going on a tear
Spin it's out!
Take it from me,
We can!

I'm not the kid from your dreams
Not the brat from your stories
Not the innocent who fell for your ruse
My whole world was altered
I can't see into the future
But I know exactly what happened to you
So I'll never know if you're still with me
I hope we can find a way to bring you back together
I know we used to be so close
And now I'm trying so hard not to laugh
I hope we can find a way to bring you back together
No one said you'd never end
You gave me the strength to face the future
And the courage to look into your heart
And to go on living my life with a broken heart
I hope we can find a way to bring you back together.
You and I

Watch him flex his muscles
And get a very, very big nose

Just follow the beaten path

Work together

TITLE: Too Close
I met a fella once who looked like me
Had a certain fin that I could feel
And I'll never forget his face
Showed me the ropes and I got the hang
He handed me a whip
And I knew it
Wasn't the flogging
For which I was summoned
But for his insolence
I would stretch the rules
And break the rules again
In the name of mercy
I shall beat him
I'll beat him into shape
In the name of love
I shall make him stand
And prove to him
He's unworthy of my affections
So he's been disgraced
And I am the avenger
Dedicated to the Lord are you ready?
Are you ready to stand
And fight
Not a man in sight
So I'm sending you, a dove at a time
Down an open door
Once a week we take a boat down to sea
And there's a feast
Once a year we send for the hedonist
And the fisherman comes
Bring the nets and the bells
The feast is extravagant
But the price is steep
So plan your sting
Sneak a peek under the docks
And wait in the boat
As the steward blows his horn
We sing out in the dark
Help our lost brother
Lost and in love
Lost and in love
Too close to call
Too close to call
Till the very last moment
I will slay the moon
Break his heart
And leave him for dead
In the dark of night, in the dark of the night
I will stalk him
Dedicate a trophy wife
Never found a worthy husband
The fates have other plans
Dedicate a trophy wife
Long live the Huntress
Aquata del Sol
Who shall we find?
Chasing a scent
Through the dark
Of the sea
The steward will hear his song
Soon he'll be heard
In praise of his valor
In the dark of the night
I will stalk him
Dedicate a trophy wife
Never found a worthy husband
The fates have other plans
Dedicate a trophy wife
Long live the Huntress

Out here on the surface of the sea
Gives me the chill
The chill never bothered me before
This is a foreign land
Full of surprises
Full of danger
And yet here I stand
And I can see straight through it
Now I know my destiny is true
There's a star waiting to guide me
To the stars far beyond the skies
Where the dogs come to love me
And the cats and the bees
Will whisper my name is Diamond Jubilee
If you get to know me
As a dog I must obey
As a cat to the queen
I won't be parted from my family
My heart will be sealed with a ring
And the world will be my oyster

Keeps so near

Sometimes I get a little freaked out

Is this a nightmare?
Am I dreaming?
Or has the dream become reality?
