TITLE: Everything You Wanted (Only Elton John)
'Cause everything we see, we must believe
And the things we see, we must believe
This is the life we've been dreaming of
A life we can share
A simple life, as beautiful as it is wild
This is the life we want
A life we can share
A simple life, as beautiful as it is wild
Watch how we move, feel, and sing
Listen to the words that I'm singing
And feel the smile that comes to you
Just let me in, I'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be
I'll lead you on a magical night
You'll be amazed at what you'll see
And how we'll make it, together
Think of the happiest things,
the happiest things can happen
When you believe, on this wilder sort of dream
Think again
Try everything, don't be afraid,
we'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be
I'll lead you on a magical night
You'll be amazed at what you'll see
And how we'll make it, together
Think of the happiest things,
the happiest things can happen
When you believe, on this wilder sort of dream
Think again
Try everything, don't be afraid,
we'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be
Watch how we move, feel, and sing
Listen to the words that I'm singing
And feel the smile that comes to you
Just let me in, I'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be
I'll lead you on a magical night
You'll be amazed at what you'll see
And how we'll make it, together
I'll lead you on a very special night
Think of the happiest things,
the happiest things can happen
When you believe, on this wilder sort of dream
Think again
Try everything, don't be afraid,
we'll let you know how to be
Wild as all you want to be
Watch how we move, feel, and sing
Listen to the words that I'm singing
And feel the smile that comes to you
Just let me in, I'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be
I'll lead you on a very special night
Just let me in, I'll show you how to be
Wild as all you want to be

TITLE: Heartfelt
tl;dr: I lost my way, and everyone looks like me
So I give myself a wide berth,
because I'm too trusting,
and I let the people I love tell me who they want to be.
They don't have to know who I am,
or where my heart is,
they can just see me do what I do.
I roll with the punches,
I sit back and wait for my turn,
when I get punched in the gut,
I get up and move on.
I see the world through,
and I see it differently,
I see the world through,
and I see there's nothing I can't do.
I roll with the punches,
I sit back and wait for my turn,
when I get punched in the gut,
I get up and move on.
I see the world through,
and I see it differently,
I see the world through.
And I see you,
here on my record,
I see you,
here on my conscience,
I see myself through,
and I see you
...everyday.

TITLE: The Way We Were
Johnny and Little August:
Now, after years of being carpenters, we've reached the height of our skill
And it's time for us to try something new
The way you and I did it all our lives:
Flyin' high, flyin' low.
Flyin' high, flyin' low.
Dies irae, dies illa (That's our sign, it's our pact) 
All gives way to dies illa (Give a little whistle, and you can blow me away) 
(Give a little whistle) 
Johnny, you and I:
We're take it from here
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Let's go, we go, we go!
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Johnny, you and I:
See our target, but we're not there to see
If we don't score a goal, there's a good chance we'll lose it
In a moment of madness, we'll both blow our horns
And blow our dukes of wills
It's a shoestring budget, guys
And we're going all the way
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up!
Shoestring budgets, guys:

TITLE: The Truth
Ruby:
I'm not the only one...
There's a whole new world out there waiting to be seen
Not just a dirt road, you know a dirt road
From swamp to prairie, from prairie to forest
Beneath the prairie sun
There's a world of discovery
There's a world I simply cannot fathom
And it's captivating to me
Now I finally understand
There's a whole new world out there waiting
To be seen
Look and see
For only the truest and bravest
Will brave the wildest mountains
Wade through the ice and the rivers
Take the dirt roads and the scrub
Drive an average Joe crazy
With a few hundred dollars to his name
A man can learn to do
This can be done with
Only the truest and bravest
Will brave the wildest mountains
Wade through the ice and the rivers
Take the dirt roads and the scrub
Drive an average Joe crazy
With a few hundred dollars to his name
A man can learn to do
This can be done with
Only the truest and bravest
Will brave the wildest mountains
Wade through the ice and the rivers

TITLE: I'm Still Here (Demi Lovato's version)
I am a question to the world
Can it be
You haven't heard the little jabberings
 from the birds
and the ants
and the beetles
all season long
I'm still here (repeated very often) 
Who is this little Antara
That glows in the dark
Every night
Like a beacon in the dark
Tell me, ask a question
And you will receive a yes or a no
If the little Antara
That glows in the dark is
A child of mine
And always will be
A child of mine

TITLE: The Way we were
Way down in the jungles of Peru
We'd be a family
And if we were smart, we'd learn to be
A man and a woman
All in the same boat
All with the same dream
All in the same boat!
As the world went round
We'd circle the globe
And carry on as we were
All in the same boat!

This is the song you've been longing to hear
Every time a star falls from the sky
You'll hear in my heart
This is the song you've been longing to hear
Every time a star falls from the sky
You'll hear in my heart
This is the song you've been longing to hear
Once a song is sung
There's a flash of inspiration
And suddenly we're back on track
I know you've been looking for the one
You've been flirting with the stars
But in the end you come to realize
This was never meant to be
There's a hitch in the road
And you know the price you've been paying
Every time a star falls from the sky
You'll hear in my heart
This is the song you've been longing to hear
Chorus:
You'll hear in my heart
This is the song you've been longing to hear
See the path that blazed through the sky
There's a flash of inspiration

You've been flirting with the stars
But in the end you come to realize
This was never meant to be
There's a hitch in the road
And you know the price you've been paying
Every time a star falls from the sky
You'll hear in my heart
This is the song you've been longing to hear

TITLE: A Room With Lowell
In the dark of night
You try to sleep
But the floodlights are on
In the dark of night
You hide under the bed
And you dream the dream
Is just a dream
But you know the dream's not that hard to pull off
It's harder than blowing your nose in the snow
The dream is so much more than that
It's a miracle if you get it right
The way the wind blows through the snow
The way the wind blows through the snow
The way you move shadows on the night
Till you get the hang of it
Hold on and try it
Try it and see
If you get it right
Then you'll see what I mean
There's more than enough here for everyone
Except you
So how do you get to Pinnochio
Down a flight of stairs
Up a flight of stairs
Down a flight of stairs
All the way to the bottom
Down a flight of stairs
Up a flight of stairs
Up a flight of stairs
Down a flight of stairs

And be careful, or we'll drown!
We know a little something about life,

down to the sea!
Up, down, around and around!

You and I are such a perfect fit

TITLE: I will stand by him
In the darkest hour
Should he cry to one of his many
Wishes?
I will stand by him
In the darkest hour (Should he cry to one of his many) 
Lost in the night
Should he lose his way
Lost in the night
Should he lose his way.
In the dark hours
Under the mist
Should he dream
Of a world without lights
I will stand by him
In the dark hours (Should he dream) 
Of loneliness and fear and anger
And why, one day, he will smile
I know one day he'll come to be
Like a true knight in shining armor
Should he win a fair fight
Should he overcome adversity
Is he a knight in shining armor too?
Gazing at the heroes he will emulate
Such a prospect to live off of
Should he win a fair fight
Overcoming adversity
Through the darkest of his setbacks
Should he win a fair fight
He would never want
This world and his king
Be as he wills it to be
A shining armor is a dangerous job
One must be brave, one must be strong
One must be smart, hardy
Heed my every order
And never take your eyes off him

I was about to blow my mind
when I heard Rapunzel say her beautiful song
theres a child behind it,
singing and chanting
a lullaby for a moment,
when the day trill they come
to a gentle curve
lullaby for a moment
when the shepherd dog
calls out to his flock
proud of his he'll show his pride
when he sees his sheep
hugged up in the air
a few pats on the back
will do just that
they will carry out their task,
standing firm on the wall
between the houses
till the shepherd dog
calls out to his flock
hugged up in the air
a few pats on the back
will do just that
they will carry out their task,
standing firm on the wall
between the houses
till the shepherd dog
calls out to his flock
hugged up in the air
a few pats on the back
will do just that
they will carry out their task,
standing firm on the wall
between the houses
till the shepherd dog
calls out to his flock
hugged up in the air
a few pats on the back

Is this a dream
Come on, Frollo, you've got to tell us
What is this?
Am I dreaming?
No, this isn't a dream
I can't believe my ears
Can I go back in time?
No, no, this isn't a dream
What is this?
Can I get some help?
I can't believe my ears
Is this some kind of a nightmare?
What if I lose you?
What if I break your heart?
If these are not dreams, what shall I do?
Stand back and watch me go
Up to the mountain tops
Where the cold wind is the hardest
If I lose you, I'll go up there on my own
Wish that this was the day
I'd let my heart keep going
Up to the mountain tops
But then I think of all the joy that it would bring
If I could find it in me to try
So I'll turn back time and see
This is a dream
From the very beginning we've been together
And I'll never let you go
