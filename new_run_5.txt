TITLE: A Simple Song About Love (Oohh)
Love is an idea that cannot be controlled. It's so beautiful, and so strange, and yet so true.
When you're lost in the night, and your heart isn't in a shred of shakier...
Your heart is too full of song to sing. But if you sing a little song,
Just a little song,
About love, about love, you'll find, it brings you closer than you can know.
If you listen to a little song,
About love, about love, you'll find, it brings you closer than you can know.
It seems like no one ever dies,
In a fit of pique, or from old age. But if you listen to a little song,
About love, about love, you'll find, it brings you closer than you can know.
If you listen to a little song,
About love, about love, you'll find, it brings you closer than you can know.

TITLE: What's Our Story
What's our story?
What's our story?
It's a story of one simple idea:
love.
It's a love story, and more
than a little bit of every kind of love.
It's a love story that we all can share.
It's a love story that's worthy of telling, and yet mysterious and beautiful.
It's a love story that will inspire us to live better lives, and yet it's far from over.
We must find a way to show our love, and to save it for our future.
As a family we must face each other head on,
filled with love.
As a kingdom we must rise above,
into the light.
As the world continues to burn, we'll remember who we are,
and what we've been through.

When an ice storm hits London,
And the ice doesn't last,
The ice queen will come to town.
She'll whip up a super-sized sleet,
That's super-super-super-super-cool.
If you don't move,
If you don't scream,
She'll just sit and watch the city burn.
After the ice has been thawed,
She'll bring back a cold that's twice as cold!
If you don't move,
If you don't scream,
She'll just sit and watch the city burn.
After the ice has been thawed,
She'll bring back a cold that's twice as cold!
If you don't move,
If you don't scream,
She'll just sit and watch the city burn.
After she's finished,
She'll bring back a cold that's twice as cold!
If you don't move,
If you don't scream,

TITLE: Happy Endings
I want to build a bridge of love
Between two worlds
There is a sweet harmony here
If I could find it in my heart
And if I could find it again tomorrow
I'd take my love to the start
And find it again if I could
I want to live out of these windows
I want to wander the world
And not be chained by time or space
I want to find where my happiness is
And if I could show him tonight
Or at the end of this long journey
I'd say the happiest thing
That I can say
Is that I want to live my life
Out of these windows
I want to be free
And I want to show him
That I am fine, I am too
I want to make him see
That I am who I am
And I want to live my life
Out of these windows
I want to be free
And I want to show him
That love can overcome
Any barrier
And to show him, too
That I am fine, I am too
I want to make him see
That I am who I am
And I want to live my life
Out of these windows
I want to be free
And I want to show him
That love can overcome
Any barrier
And to show him, too
I want to live my life
Out of these windows

I know how the world can turn
And I know how it can end
Like the flood
(Mike) Let it go
(Sulley) They'll come to take me back where they belong

(Sulley) We don't have to worry anymore
(Mike) We can be out of here as soon as we fall in love
(Moana) What do you think we'll see?
(All) In the distance
(Mike) There we'll see a pale, sad, and frightened moon
(All) With the pounding of the ocean
(Mike) And the laughter
(All) We'll think this love is strange
(Moana) This could be the beginning
(All) Of a new and happier world.

TITLE: POSSESSED
By the time we're through, I won't mind if he wants to be mine or my own. I'll regret it if he doesn't want to be mine.
But we haven't got time for kissing, just yet.
One move at a time, slowly, surely, one after the other.
Saying our vows, I will become his bride.
And if he doesn't want to be mine, well then I'm not in the mood.
I won't listen to anyone who says I can't.
And if he won't let me be, well then I'm not in the mood either.
My heart won't take me, either.
And if he doesn't want to be mine, well then somebody else will.
Just as long as I stay in his embrace. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's!

to the shore and that's fine

when the sun begins to rise
above the pale blue sky
i'm wet 'till the tide comes
to shore and that's fine
when you're dead

when the sun begins to rise
above the pale blue sky
i'm wet 'till the tide comes

you'll be warm and dry
once you find your place
well you've come far
far far far far far

TITLE: Bad To The Bone
Get up and get out
There's a land you can see before you blink
And when you start to see the beauty
Let your guard down
Just a little longer
And when the sky is dark and stormy
You can still feel the love
Oh you won't want to miss this
Because it's gonna be big
We're knocking on the door of love
And if you're listening
It's gonna be bigger than the sum of its parts
We're knocking on the door of love
And if you're ready
For the rush of the night
Just for you
In the arms of my love
Are those few tears you're crying
Right now we're feeling each other's arms and feeling each other's wings
Come on come on come on
And if you're ready
Just for you
In the arms of my love
Are those few tears you're crying
Right now we're feeling each other's arms and feeling each other's wings
Come on come on come on
And if you're ready
Just for you
In the arms of my love
Are those few tears you're crying
Right now we're feeling each other's arms and feeling each other's wings
Come on come on come on
And if you're ready
Just for you
In the arms of my love
[Chorus]
Just for you
In the arms of my love

A girl worth fighting for
Should a heroic spirit
Leave her world behind?

His destiny, untied
His vows, not to tear her away

And who knows what's in you

TITLE: Love
You and I were once like so many other
like so many others, just like so many others
after so many others,
lives and loves that we all share.
And though it seems like such a small thing
like falling in love
after all these years
we still love passionately
you and I
We used to be so few and so many
like so many others,
just like so many others.

TITLE: All About That time
That time, just before dawn
When the sky was clear and the ground was soft
All around, life was joyful.
In the world wide wide wide web,
Linked by the tiniest of tiny streams
There was far too much to hold my attention
Just then, just as I dream,
A voice calls out to me, call me now!
Whose stream do I suppose to follow?
My heart says to welcome the sunshine
And now, just as it seems I'm passing through
A rainbow appears over a blue sky
No more clouds to hide in
And above all else, just as I hope
I'll find a place to call home
Anytime that I'll wander
And when I do, my heart will be with you
So, just before dawn, so I can hear my dream
Saying all about that time, just before dawn
I wish that the dreams that I have now,
Are as good as my first
Because they were as good as they could be

TITLE: Dashing Chase
My name is Dashing Chase, and when I'm in trouble
Just call me "shaw." But when I'm in trouble, don't you call me

For my mother's sake, don't you throw her overboard
For her sake, don't you forget it
When I'm in trouble, don't you call me, my mother will hear me scream
And when I'm right, don't you call me back
Every day, just forget about me, and everything will be alright
My mother's a strong woman, yes, she is, a strong woman
But she's also, a foolish woman
So, a foolhardy woman, yes, I am
So a foolhardy woman, yes, I am
My mother's a strong woman, yes, she is
But she's also, a foolish woman
So, a foolhardy woman, yes, I am
My father's a strong man, yes, he is
But he's also, a foolish woman

TITLE: The Best of Both Worlds
If I could turn back the years and create a new life
Where two worlds would come together
I'd be so proud of who I would be
Like a loving embrace
I would find myself in his arms every night
But there's no moment I'm fearful of
As long as I can remember
When I can see him through
His smile
His eyes
Their connection
Is undeniable
And I can finally see it
The way they used to light up my world
I can finally feel the way they did
As long as I can remember
When I can see him through
His smile
His eyes
Their connection
Is undeniable
And I can finally see it
The way they used to light up my world

TITLE: I'm still standing
Saying, Your Honor, I'm still standing
When my heart wasn't in a loop
And I was caught flatfooted
In a jumble
And you all stood by my side
Still holding fast to what I know
I can still feel
That familiar sense of dread
That familiar ache
Don't you know what it's like?
To feel so close, and yet so far
I'm a-lapsed
And my head's up in a cloud
Could somebody hold me when I cry?
I'm so dry your eyes
What's the matter with me?
No one says you can't, only you
Sometimes it's easier to say you can't
But you'll never know, that feeling you have for me
So many secrets to share
All I had wanted to know all along
Well who would I be if I told you?
What's the matter with me?
Would anybody believe me?
No one says you can't, only you
But you'll never know, that feeling you have for me
There's nothing to lose
And everything to learn
And when the time comes, you'll find me
I'm still standing
You'll see me, I'm still standing
And I'm still standing when my heart stops beating
And someone taps me on the shoulder
And says, don't run, don't hide
I'm still standing, even though I've had to stop and see
Just how far I've come, I'm still standing

In this industrial city
There's a man in the street wearing jeans and a hood
He's got a sign saying "Work Hard Or Go Home"
And a glare
That's him just trying to get seen
But I'm guessing he doesn't see the reaction
He won't even know
That his creation's on the line
Pumping iron's golden meanin' time
Is running out
He can't lose
He's a giant if he can't lose
And if he loses he'll be screwed
How about a few extra yards
Before he counts as a worker
And that's what this is all about
He's a giant if he can't lose
And if he loses he'll be screwed
How about a few extra yards
Before he counts as a worker
And that's what this is all about

I chose you,

You're a dream come true,

Aaliyah, you've been looking for a dream,

You can love someone

And it doesn't have to be a killer
You can love someone
You can love someone
In just your shoes
In just your shoes
Shoe made of seashells and heliotrope
Shoe made of seashells and carpenter's tools
Shoe made of seashells and the attic
Shoe made of seashells and then

You can love somebody
You can love someone
And it doesn't have to be a killer
You can love someone
And it doesn't have to be a killer
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
One hit ahead of the diamond cutter
One hit ahead of the black cat
One hit ahead of the hairy crab
One hit ahead of the hooked louse
One hit ahead of the glad-handing cat
One hit ahead of the glad-handing cat
The hairy crab only wants one
He wants one so bad
That when he gets hungry, he'll eat half of them
When he gets hungry, he'll eat two thirds
And then he'll be satisfied
To his greedy nature, known only to him
