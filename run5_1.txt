TITLE: Home
I miss the way you used to play
The way you held your head down
When you used to stand there, as a statue
Ooh, what a shame
You were never quite as strong
And your body began to betray you
I wish we'd never met
I wish we'd never met
Homes were built for me, not you
And I fell far from the people I used to know
I wish we'd never met
I'm a changed man now, see my eyes
And if I had a dime for every time you stood there
I'd be a millionaire
You were never quite as strong
You tried to be tough
But your body began to betray you
And you tried to think of new ways to hurt me
See the world through your eyes
What did I lose?
See the world through your eyes
What did I lose?
Nothing, really, really
Nothing, really, really
Nothing, really, really
The way you used to hold your head down
When you used to stand there as a statue
Ooh, what a shame
You were never quite as strong
And your body began to betray you
I wish we'd never met
I wish we'd never met
Homes were built for me, not you
And I fell far from the people I used to know
I wish we'd never met
I'm a changed man now, see my eyes
And if I had a dime for every time you stood there
I'd be a millionaire
You were never quite as strong
You tried to be tough
But your body began to betray you
And you tried to think of new ways to hurt me
See the world through your eyes
What did I lose?
See the world through your eyes
What did I lose?
Nothing, really, really

A new friend has just arrived
Just when you were all waiting
He came to you
He's black and he's brown
He's loud and he's gut
He's loud and he's gut
He's the voice of the people
And he shakes everything to the core
The people know he's a king
The people know he's a lion King

How we made that barn sing

TITLE: The Circle Of Life
From the day we arrive on the planet
To the very end
There is a distance between us
And it seems like forever
But nothing can ever be quite like it was
Before you were born
And everything you see,
Is just a dream from the start
Even though we know the truth
There is a journey to be
And you'll come to understand
The time has come, my child,
To look at life from inside
Out
And see for yourself
The circle of life
Is a wondrous thing
Imagine a globe,
Shining with a single star
What would an empty globe be
Like
Imagine a rowing boat,
Shining with a single sail
The circle of life
Would be a boat races
Forth with a single course
Circle with a single star
So what do you suppose they do?
They sail across the stream
They row, they sail
Wish they'd ride a rough course
But they don't come close to being
As awe-inspiring as a vase
A banquet hall may be
But a banquet hall is no match for a thousand carp
Ready, I say,
Go forth, you who you are
And make the circle!

TITLE: Trust In Me
Take a cup of all you wish
Fill it with cold water
And let it sit there till spring
Then you can fill the cup with ice
And let it stay as frozen as a rock
This way you'll never get cold
There's always a cold wind blowing
Through the sky
So if you wish, you can always use the river
It's icy cold
Though it's icicle deep in the marsh
You can always use the stream
It's icy cold
Even when it's pretty cold
It's still got that power
To make you feel like you belong
You can beat a bush
Just look at the size of their ears
They'll beat a bush
Until they learn
The hard way
That cold hard truth
There is no lake, there is no stream
So how do you know
The lost and forgotten
And they're the ones
Who look to you
For the answer
To this burning question
Why do they keep coming
Coming back to the river
Why do they keep falling
To the lake?
I'll tell you what you shall.
Start a fire, burn up the swamp
Dig up a hole, climb a mountain
Dig up a shaft
And dig a grave
Waste without fear
All will go
To the promised land
Where there's a rainbow
Will show you where it's at
The promise of opportunity
Are there no responsibilities
On the other side
Of the invisible fence
Are there no rules
On the other side
Of the mountain range
Can you see it?
Can you hear it?
Can you feel it?
You want it, come to think of it
You're the people who keep coming
Coming back to the river
Come back to the plain
Duck up a low hill
Dig a long ways
Down into the dark
Hollows with no names
Keep trying, but it's a case of
Slimy's Law of Reciprocity
First come first serve
Keep coming back to the river
Come back to the plain
Duck up a low hill
Dig a long ways
Down into the dark
Haunted houses with ghosts
Will whisper in your ear
Soon all will be forgotten
The past, the present and the future
Stand back and let the river flow

Two things I learned in my studies were that
a) Boys don't dig up abandoned buildings
b) Boys don't dig up abandoned buildings
c) Boys dig up abandoned buildings
d) Boys dig up abandoned buildings
These were the only two things I learned
In my studies
Studying boys
I studied them hunching over

With more than his fair share
Of honey, naturally
He will find a haven
Within his heart
Within his very heart
He will learn
(Honey, it's ours) 
And grow to love
(Honey, it's ours) 
Like his mother
(He's a lucky gal) 
He could make
Give a queen a son
Who'll be a king
Without any royal blood
There's a chance he'll grow
To love a princess
He'll wash and polish
With as little fuss
As a zebra drabble

This is my lullaby
This is my lullaby
The beating of the drums of war
The dying cry
And the thrill of a Bleeing Berserker
Though drenched in blood, it's sweeter than ever
Now I've found my love
Who could ask for more?
A big juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy
Full of flavor, perfect for eating
This time, this time
I devoured the whole thing in one go
This time, this time
I'll be pitiful
Don't you worry I won't cry
Gee, thanks anyway
Old man Gaston is a swell guy
You think he's a stretch
But really, he's a knockout
You can beat him with a bush
And that's something to think about
Let's all try it, see if we can pull it off
Like a pro, he can, can do it too
Like a pro, he can, can do it
Gaston:
You mean Gaston?
Revel:
Yes, Gaston.
Gaston:
We'll raise a toast to commemorate
The day he turned nine
And we'll light a candle to commemorate
The day he won't cry
Now's the time, boys, to sing out
Alongside Gaston
Gaston:
Wish I could be, a part of this
I'd live my fantasies
Out in the field,
Singing along,
A fantasy world,
Where Gaston and Chorus:
I could be a king
Gaston:
And a hero too!
Chorus:
A hero never dies
Gaston:
The more I hear the more I see
The more I become convinced
That a hero never dies
And every little incident
Will make him a hero in my book
Gaston:
Don't you despair, little man
It's not your fault
The less I hear the more I see
The more I become convinced
That a hero never dies
And every little incident
Will make him a hero in my book
Chorus:
And he'll be a hero in mine as well
Gaston:
So, in a world where Gaston is king
The more I hear the more I see
The more I become convinced
That a hero never dies
And every little incident
Will make him a hero in my book
Chorus:
And he'll be a hero in mine as well!
Gaston:
I can do anything hero-like can do
Chorus:
I can do anything hero-like can do
Gaston:
You can do it too
Chorus:
We can do it too
Gaston:
You'll have a champion in Gaston
Chorus:
I can do anything hero-like can do
Gaston:
You'll have a champion in Gaston
Gaston:
I can do anything hero-like can do
Gaston:
See that you keep quiet
Now is the time
Keep quiet and carry on
As you see yourself and Gaston through a love story
One happy ending, I can see
'Twas always planned
This was not an accident
Some mischief-making
Some sadistic
Some sweet
Some terrible
This was no accident
Some crimes against nature
Would be forgiven
If the monsters got their comeuppance
While the victims waited in the monster's den
'Twas always planned
This was not an accident
Some mischief-making
Some sadistic
Some sweet
Some terrible
This was no accident
Some crimes against nature
'Twas a love
Between Gaston and Chorus
Out the door, watch it from the window
A monster is waiting
With a sickle and a hook
Make way for Gaston
Chorus:
Gaston:
'Cause it's Gaston!
Chorus:
Gaston:
Gaston: Look out!
Watch out!
Stay in the firelight.
Stay in the firelight.
'Cause the monster is real
And he's coming soon
Watch out!
Keep an eye out!
Monster or man?
Watch out!
Keep an eye out!
'Cause the world is getting too hot
So they made Gaston and Chorus:
Gaston: Look out!
Watch out!
Find a firelight.
Find a firelight.
Gaston: If there's one thing I learned from growing up
It's that a wall's good, but a candle's better
Keep an eye out!
Keep an eye out!
For the world is getting too hot
So they made Gaston and Chorus:
Gaston: Watch out!
Move over, spread out.

Yo, listen up,
Have a howler from Dr. Jekyll
Dr. Jekyll is a tall, dark, hunchback with a goatee
He's a bit of a spook
He's a bit of a screamer
Look out for Dr. Jekyll
In the snow, or down at the bottom of the valley
You'll see him perched on a big yule log,
Dr. Jekyll, Dr. Jekyll
The naked mole rat
The naked mole rat
Hear him bellowing in the forest
Old Jekyll, he's the voice of the wilderness
He's a speaker, not a singer
Listen to him rant in the wilderness
How the hunter sounds
With the dog and the antlers
Swift as a fox on his feet
One cannot ignore him
And his aching heart
Will make you reconsider
The very thing you were born to do
Was hunt and gather
In the forest, under the stars
Who's a better friend?
The forest, the forest
Yes, yes, of course
The naked mole rat is the land's most cunning
The naked mole rat is a savage
A bear who's ready for the pull
The naked mole rat is a beauty
A rose to cut through the forest
Like a hyena at the base of a tree
He'll eat you in half
(He'll eat you in half) 
[Chorus:]
In the forest, under the stars
Who's a better friend
The forest, the forest
Yes, yes, of course
The naked mole rat is the land's most cunning
The naked mole rat is a savage
A bear who's ready for the pull
The naked mole rat is a beauty
A scurvy keg alarmingly ticklish
[Verse 2: 11]
Time to freshen up,
Hang in there,
Keep it up,
Take it up,
Keep it up,
This is our jam
Keep it up,
Keep it up,
No more drugs, no more sex!
Hard times,
Be prepared,
Be prepared,
Be prepared,
For the unknown is a wilder
Various are the ways to be
In the forest, in the forest
Through the mist, under the trees
Who's a better friend,
The forest, the forest
Yes, yes, of course
The naked mole rat is the land's most cunning
The naked mole rat is a savage
A bear who's ready for the pull
The naked mole rat is a beauty
[Chorus:]
A rose to cut through the forest
Like a hyena at the base of a tree
He'll eat you in half
(He'll eat you in half) 
[Verse 3: 12]
If you can learn to do it,
I can learn to do it too!
It's not what you know,
It's what you find!
When life gets rough,
Call on me,
Hang in there,
Keep it up,

Enough is enough,
Keep your nasty little songs and dance la-dee-da!
We can do anything,
We can do anything,
Steal our thunder, we can do magic
Break their hearts, we'll make 'em fall apart
These poor unfortunate souls,
Their very lives are in danger,
They don't know what to do
'Cause we did our best,
We're better now, and we're better still
'Cause we showed 'em, we showed 'em

Each and everyone of us a fool
To tell the world a lie
We set the stage for him to strut his stuff
And look where he's become
Not a scratch on the surface
He's a sapling, not a tree
He's a celebrity!

when we're in the sack
we got some explaining to do
baby we're human too
see how we got here
follow the road map
go the distance
make no mistake
human beings are fallible
see the flaws in all of us
see the life is full of sorrow
for the world goes still
on it goes
on it goes the road we love
wherever we go
find the love we need
make an entrance,
keep moving forward
i will defend you
build a wall,
build a ditch,
build a ditch around you
keep going,
keep going,
on,

Hey, you think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing
But I know a few secrets
Picking a side
You can own the whole earth
You can own the whole sky
You can own the world
All you need is a little help from you
So how do you get what you want
Where are the graves?
Where are the bones?
You just gotta dig a little deeper
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig it up
Dig, Dig, Dig, dig it up
Dig, Dig, Dig it up
Dig, Dig, Dig it up
Dig it up
Dig it up
Dig it up
Dig it up

TITLE: Descendants
What started out as a simple backwater romance has evolved into a romantic epic.
Two strangers on a dark mountain path
Together they tell an epic tale.
The thrill ride, the tragedy the hero
Can do much worse than to descend that mountain
Together they'll meet a tragic end.
We've come a long way, we've come a long way
And we're going all the way back up to the beginning
To the start where things began.
Without you there'll be no "us".
Without you there'll be no "us"
I know that this may be a stretch
But it's the truth.
And as the cold weather sets in
I'm feeling better now, feeling more at home
With the knowledge that I finally, finally, have some security
I've found what I need, I've found who I am
And all the memories start fading away
All the world is still a scene from a dark fantasy
But the truth is, I've lived my life
And it never was
So I can finally, finally, finally, finally
Walk in concert
With the people I used to know
Chorus:
I have to face the world alone
With the loneliness and the fear
I can finally, finally, finally, finally
Walk in concert
With the people I used to know
If I let go, all the pain
All the rage and the lust
Will just build up again
Chorus:
Like a thief in the night,
Like a lion in the bush
I'll lay low and wait for the right moment
To break into his lair
Chorus:
He'll come one, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
Chorus:
With a broken heart,
With a broken head
I can finally, finally, finally, finally
Walk in concert
With the people I used to know

But, come to think of it
Let's not fool around
For once we know where we are
And don't get caught up in the moment
It's hard to leave a scene this way
Friends like you and me
Lost and falling through
Life is a strange road
And sometimes, you can die
The road turns and you're upside down
But you keep going, you keep going
Just keep walking
Like you're stuck inside of a dream
And you'll see, it's the most beautiful thing
That ever happened to me
No, it's the most beautiful thing
That ever happened to me
I've been around the block before
All my life, I've been told
Don't mess this up again
Let's go, make your move
Face it head on
Push this button, pull this out
And do what you wanna
Mine this button, go do what you wanna
Pull this out, go do what you wanna
Mine this one out, go do what you wanna
Push this button, pull this out
And do what you wanna
Mine this one out, go do what you wanna
[Goofy:]
And I was about to start it up
When this all started
I nearly jumped out of my skin
And I almost fell out of my skin
Just let me in
And we could make this road
This road, this road
Long as we make it
Together we can!

What a wonderful world I know! I see it from an imaginative point of view. I'm a child of the past, a princess without a kingdom to rule. I'm an outcaste who've turned into a princess in a million miles.
One journey to renew my vows and to find my love.
Will I be a princess or a king?
Or will I find my love in a million miles?
All I have to do is rub like so: "Be careful," say the petey children.
And repeat, rub like so: "Don't drop your head."
A princess without a kingdom can be a kingdom without a queen.
It's easier said than done, but it's doable.
The hardest part is finding the right prince.
Though it's a long shot, it's doable.
The princess without a kingdom can be a princess without a king.
It's easier said than done, but it's doable.

To lay your dew on the ground

and to all those I just met
See that sunbeam on you,
how it shines through you.

I'm ready for a truly foreign
We don't need to go far
To a foreign land
My heart is ready for the cup
For the cup of tea
With the milk and the bread we'll be served
In a private corner
Until such a time
I'm sure everyone will be waiting
Ready, prepared,
Ready, ready,
We need to talk
I'll bet you've heard of a place
called Japantown
A japantown is a dangerous place
Everyone knows it
There's always a guard dog
Just a few pips to go
And then the knife will be out
For the rest of us
In the dark, the moon
The night will never come
Knew too well
It's a world of shadows
And secrets we don't want to tell
Somehow we'll get through
Japantown!

And we'll all be rich and free

There's diamonds like debris
There's silver rivers flow
And gold you pick right off a tree
With a nugget for my Winnie
And another one for me
And all the rest'll go
To The Virginia Company
For glory, God and gold

The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because
They'd been swimming in them all summer
The fish were pink and the shell was grey
The water was murky and murky dark
The fish were round and the shell was square
The fish were broad and the shell was broad
The fish were long and the shell was long
The fish were snouty and the snail-like thing was round
The fish were broad and the shell was broad
