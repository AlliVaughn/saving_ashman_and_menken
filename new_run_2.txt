TITLE: If I Didn't Wanna Get Out (Single Version)
Laverne:
I'm a girl in need of a man
To be a girl like me
And not feel so down
And not be a girl in a boy's body
All it takes is a kiss
To turn my heart to steel
And if he's cold, we won't kiss
Because we'd rather be cold
At least for a while
Warm embraces and bear hugs
And suck on his ear
And hold him when he sings
And when he says we'll meet again, we will find new ways to be
Together as one
If I weren't so down
I'd play guitar for fun
And knit for me and be a housewife
And cook and clean and stay in
The pale moonlight

====================
TITLE: My Desire (Django)
One, two, three, four
I need two, three, four
I want more
I want more
In just in time for Christmas
I need two, three, four
I want more
In just in time for Christmas
I need two, three, four
I want more
Every night more
I dream about
Howling it out of the sky
With a little song to help me along the way
I'll sing a little song
And when I get lonely...I'll think of all the joy I felt when I sing
In just in time for Christmas

TITLE: The First Time
I was a child prodigy
so how could my cruel and --
Father want me to shrink?
So I learned to love myself
And not to hate my father
But still I dream of his touch
Scrub the pavement and mend the clothes
Wherever I may be
And he's an old man and -
All because I was in his arms
I can't leave him be
But I dream of his touch
Scrub the pavement and mend the clothes
Wherever I may be
And he's an old man and -
All because I was in his arms
I can't leave him be
But I dream of his touch

====================
TITLE: How Deep Is The Sea
How far does the sea go?
Or how far does it pull me?
If the world is still young, if the world is still wondrous,
If the sea is still where I want it to be,
I will never know, my heart will be cruel,
My hands will carry me far, far away
The sea will always be cruel, my hands will carry me far away
I will find my place in the sea, I will find my place in the sea, I will find my place in the sea

TITLE: The Truth About Love
The truth about love
The truth about love
There's a time and a place
And I'll never want to leave
But I know the way to find
The love that I've been dreaming of
The truth about love
There's a time and a place
And I'll never want to leave but I know the way to find
The love that I've been dreaming of
The truth about love

TITLE: Good Night
Good night
Sleep your lazy days
To the firelight
That's the way you know
The way you feel when you're close to me
When I'm lonely in the dark
And there's no one home to love you, lonely at last
Good night

TITLE: The Best Of Both Worlds
He may be rough around the edges, but that's the best of both worlds
You and I can explore unchartered waters
You can relive summers past
As warm and as real as the sun
You can ride the pine trails of your youth
As the seas have steeped and been sewn
You can tour the marvels that are our shared childhood past
Tucked away in your childhood vault
You can set aside your differences and unite
In a world that's seemingly built by them
He may be rough around the edges, but that's the best of both worlds

====================
TITLE: Home Alone 
Welcome, my little one, to your big home, where you'll learn to be a girl
And be happy coming back to you
One way or another, I'll be coming --
You're welcome!
Honey, come get your very own
Welcome, my little one
To your big home, where you'll learn to be a girl
And you'll find the world has not been so hard
It seems like your world has not been so harsh
On the bright side, I'll be coming --
You're welcome!

====================
TITLE: Love
Love
It's strange,
You see,
It's like a dream come true
You thought it impossible,
And yet here you stand,
Impossible to be sure
But you know that it's true
There's a kind of peace and serenity
That seems to flow almost without your awareness
Though your heart is still beating
You can see it,
You can feel it,
The love you feel for someone else
Into the most innocent of all vases
You can feel it too,
Like a fairy tale romance
Oh, oh, you are such a wonderful girl
Such a lovely girl
Such a sweet and innocent girl
It's strange,
You cannot see it,
But you know that it's true
There's a kind of peace and serenity
That seems to flow almost without your awareness
Though your heart is still beating
You can see it,
You can feel it,
The love you feel for someone else
Into the most innocent of all vases 
You can feel it,
You can feel it,
The love you feel for someone else 
The most innocent of all vases

TITLE: The Bare Necessities of Life
When it seemed as though the world was cavin' a
scoldin'
Over some beanstalk'
I ain't hungry
And I ain't thirsty
And I ain't wired
And I ain't wired
That ain't all I need
The bare necessities of life

====================
TITLE: What's My Name
What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?
Why is my name so unique?
Because I don't know!
I don't know if I'm going to find love,
Or if I'm going to find love.
And even though I know I'm going to find love,
I don't know if I'll find love.
And even though I know I'm going to find love,
I don't know if I'll find love.

====================
TITLE: The Good Life
Take a deep breath and hold it. Now's the time. Now's the time.
Put your faith in what you most believe in.
Everything will be all right.
You'll be safe and happy until the end.
Oh, and the law does not apply to me.
The law does not apply to me.
And for once, at least, I know I can just say, "No thanks."
The time has come, finally, I can say, "No thanks."
And I can do it because I know, because I know.
Because I know because I've been looking for it everywhere I go.
Because I've been looking for it all my life.
And because I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, oh, end.

====================
TITLE: D-D-Dancing Donuts
I got no fancy clothing or shoes,
So I just stand there and do a do-do-do-do-do-do-do
'Cause i don't need no platform
To show off, 'cause im all dressed and polished
And it's much more comfortable that way
You can dance on the steps of the Empire State Building
[singing]
Dancing donuts are a wonderful treat
When you order them, they come out donuts!
When you buy them in a store, they come out donuts!
Well if i remember correctly, today was the day!
And it's a Tuesday, so i walked right up and down
The stairs weren't that far, so i just laid there and watched them float by
And a funny feeling swept me off my feet,
So i went ahead and did a do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
And when i came through the front door,
God, i don't want to miss a thing!
The employees were nice, they asked me what to do,
And i told them, i don't know, it's just d-.. dancing donuts.
They hadn't even noticed me,
They were just focusing on their phone calls,
And i, i don't know, i was just floating along
And suddenly they noticed me,
And started swooning, I mean it's so adorable!
Oh no, no, no, no, donuts!
I'm dashing, I'm doin' a do-do-do-do-do-to
Today I'm a-lmost-happy-happily-ever-time!
Oh no, no, no, no, donut
I'm dashing, I'm doin' a do-do-do-do-to
Today I'm a-lmost-happy-happily-ever-time!

TITLE: Home From Hell
Devil May Cry Music Album
Welcome to Hell
You're welcome to call it home
But we're not there yet
If you don't come through
We don't come through
And God help us all
If you don't come through
We don't come through
There's a world that we're missing
And if you don't come through
We don't come through
And God help us all

====================
TITLE: My Name Is
My name is not my name
My name is not my name
What was once my name
Is now just my name
My name is not my name
The bell ringer for fear
The spider for faunsiness
The idyllic setting for me
So how can I find my way home?
Through the mist
And how can I know if the wolf is still at large?
I will find my way
Through the woods
And how can I know if the lion is still at large?
I will find my way
Through the woods
And how can I know if the leopard is still at large?
I will find my way
Mister Caper has a vision
Of a happy ending
He thinks that I will
My name is not my name
My name is not my name

====================
TITLE: The Aristocrats
When I was a boy, my father was a great leader.
Father had a way of telling time,
And if you weren't awake,
Then you weren't paying attention.
And if you didn't hear me,
Then something was, uh- oh.
My father had an idea.
He wanted me to join him in battle.
He wanted me to serve him with honor.
And if I should lose my honor,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my dignity,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my dignity,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my honor,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my dignity,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my honor,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my honor,
He wanted me to know that he cared.
And if I should lose my honor,
He wanted me to know that he cared.

TITLE: My Valentine
My vampiric impulse
My sadomasochistic thrill
I don't care how old or lame
I'm still in her blood
And I know she's feeling it
And she'll be even sweeter without it
When we meet again

====================
TITLE: A Guy Like Me
A guy like me can learn to be a gal
Can get laid in an hour
A guy as tough as nails
Can learn to be a gal
Can get away with being a total flipper
A guy with no shirt
Can learn to be a gal
Can teach a guy to be a gal
Can get away with being a total flipper
A guy who can learn to be a gal

====================
TITLE: I'll Be There
TITLE: I'll be there
When your heart needs me
I'll be there to love
The way you need me
To keep you safe and warm
I'll be there for you whatever
The world can throw at you
It can be overwhelming
And it's easy to fall apart
But you must know that I will be there
In the end
Cause the only person who knows me
Is I
Every turn of my wrist
Every kiss I take
Every moment I spend with you
I'll be there
You will be safe and warm
I'll be there wherever you go
Because the only person who knows me
Is I

====================
TITLE: Ironic
If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I would chew its cud
If I could take it back now
but I can't
Because my conscience tells me so
So don't try to fool around
I've got a conscience too
And you can too
Come what may
I'm gonna take it back now
and if there's a prize for rotten judgement
I would chew its cud
If I could take it back now
but I can't
Because my conscience tells me so
So don't try to fool around
I've got a conscience too
And you can too
Come what may
I'm gonna take it back now

====================
TITLE: The Truth About Love
When two strangers meet in the dark
And their hearts is as black as sin
Tell me, oh stranger, did they meet in the dark?
The truth about love shall set you free
To find your true love, and who is she?
The truth about love is as black as sin
You can learn the truth about love from her
The truth about love is as black as sin
The sun caught in raven hair
Is as bright as the firelight
Is as white as snow
Is as blue as the sky
Is as rich as gold
Is as fair as fair
You can learn the truth about love from her
The truth about love is as black as sin

My name is not my name is not my name is not my name is not
My name is not my name is not my name is not my name is not

====================
TITLE: My Valentine
My vampiric thrill
My vampire kiss
My sweet caress
Today is my lucky day
it's my "diamond in the rough"
So c'mon dancin' now
It's my "funeral"
While the fiancée is still inside me
I feel her pulse
Though she's dead
My horrible dream
My pathetic attempt
So jolly good-bye
To blood, and love

One year ago today
I met you at a party.
And for one night only
I'll remember you.
And for one night only

One year ago tonight
I finally can see you
And I can finally kiss the parents goodbye
Because it's the only night I'll ever have

TITLE: The Price Of Freedom
Folks, we got the price of freedom
Got the bill of sale right
Got the daddy of the house
Mother always knows best
Tell her kid not to worry
And just in case her concerns are legitimate
The lady will come round and say
"The price of freedom is tippity-tappity tippity-tappity"
The lady will say "That settles the score"
And the bargain is done
The buyer gets the gold he deserves
And the gold is secluded
In a vaulted space"
Wait just a minute
There's no safe haven
Just a little place where they can run
And they'll come and go as they please
As long as we're in the dark"
They got the key and they got the way
They got the bill of sale right
They got the daddy of the house
Mother always knows best
Tell her kid not to worry
And just in case her concerns are legitimate
The lady will come round and say
The price of freedom is tippity-tappity tippity-tappity
The lady will say "That settles the score"

TITLE: I'm an American Too
Every country I've ever known has had its share of drama.
From the cradle to the grave.
In the name of all that is good.
We all must learn to live as strangers.
All the time.
In the dark of the night.
When the world is calling you.
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Can you feel the anger in their eyes?
You're an orphan from a crying need?
Bless you right heart and soul.
In the name of all that is pure and good.
We're one nation by birthright
And by bloodright.
E Pluribus unum est patriae (one nation under God) 
Vive la divinitatis (all God's children one nation) 
Mix it all together and what do you get?
One nation that's all too pleased with its own.
What's this? What's this?
They're chanting out your name!
