Aladdin,A Whole New World,"(Aladdin) I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
(Jasmine) A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Aladdin) Now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Jasmine) Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
(Jasmine) A whole new world
(Aladdin) Don't you dare close your eyes
(Jasmine) A hundred thousand things to see
(Aladdin) Hold your breath - it gets better
(jasmine) I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
(Aladdin) A whole new world
(Jasmine) Every turn a surprise
(Aladdin) With new horizons to pursue
(Jasmine) Every moment gets better
(Both) I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
(Aladdin) A whole new world
(Jasmine) A whole new world
(Aladdin) That's where we'll be
(Jasmine) That's where we'll be
(Aladdin) A thrilling chase
(Jasmine) A wondrous place
(Both) For you and me

Hercules ,Disney's Hercules Go The Distance,"I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a great warm welcome
Will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be
I will find my way
I can go the distance
I'll be there someday
If I can be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere
To feel like I belong
I am on my way
I can go the distance
I don't care how far
Somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere
to find where I belong
I will beat the odds
I can go the distance
I will face the world
Fearless, proud, and strong
I will please the gods
I can go the distance
Till I find the Hero's welcome
Right where I belong

The magic of Disney,Someday My Prince Will Come,"Someday my prince will come
Someday I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper I love you
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I know at the moment we meet
oh, my heart will start skipping a beat
Someday we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday my prince will come
Someday we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and weddingbells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true

Beauty And The Beast,Beauty And The Beast,"Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

Lion king,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"Timon and Pumba:
I can see what's happening (what?!) 
And they don't have a clue (who?!) 
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (ooh.) 
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air!
Chorus
Nala:
Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once
In perfect harmony
With all its living things
Simba:
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me
Nala:
He's holding back he's hiding
But what I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?
Chorus
Nala and Simba:
Can you feel the love tonight

And if he falls in love tonight (sniff) 
It can be assumed
His care-free days with us are history
In short our pal is doomed!

Mulan (Disney soundtrack), I'll Make A Man Out Of You,"Shang:
Let's get down to business--to defeat the Huns! (Hah!) 
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you!
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you!
Chien-Po:
I'm never gonna catch my breath
Yao:
Say good-bye to those who knew me

Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

Moana,I am moana,"Gramma Tala): I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you,
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are
The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on Earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana, you've come so far
Moana, listen
Do you know who you are?
(Moana): Who am I?
I am the girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all
It's inside me
It's like the tide, always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart
You'll remind me
That come what may, I know the way
I am Moana!

I love to laugh
It's getting worse every year
The more I laugh
The more I fill with glee
The more the glee
The more I'm a merrier me
The more I'm a merrier me
Some people laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this:
Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Some laugh too fast:
Some only blast
Others they twitter like birds
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind:
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak: Hee!
As the squeakelers do
I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho, ha ha ha ha
And a ha ha ha ha... too!
We love to laugh
Loud and long and clear
We love to laugh
So everybody can hear
The more you laugh
The more you fill with glee
And the more the glee
The more we're the merrier we!

Tangled,I See the Light,"(Rapunzel)

All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing just how blind I'd been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be
And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

All those years living in a blur

And I wanna tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me
As long as I know who I am
And I want a moment to be real,
Wanna touch things I don't feel,
Wanna hold on and feel I belong.
And how can the world want me to change?
Theyâ€™re the ones that stay the same.
They canâ€™t see me,
But Iâ€™m still here.
They canâ€™t tell me who to be,
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m not what they see.
Yeah, the world is still sleepinâ€™,
While I keep on dreaminâ€™ for me.
And their words are just whispers
And lies that Iâ€™ll never believe.
And I want a moment to be real,
Wanna touch things I don't feel,
Wanna hold on and feel I belong.
And how can they say I never change?
Theyâ€™re the ones that stay the same.
Iâ€™m the one now,
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m still here.
Iâ€™m the one,
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m still here.
Iâ€™m still here.
Iâ€™m still here.
Iâ€™m still here.

Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

Tangled,I've Got a Dream,"Hook Hand Thug:
I'm malicious, mean and scary!
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest...
But despite my evil look
And my temper
And my hook!
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist.
Can you see me on the stage performing Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'till they gleam
Yes, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley!
'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream!

You can count me with the dreamers
Like 'vrybody else, I've got a dream!

I've got scars and lumps and bruises
And something here that oozes?
And let's not even mention my complexion!
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter
And my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can you see me with a special little lady?
Rowing in a rowboat down a stream
Though, I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover! Not a fighter
'Cause way down deep inside, I've got a dream
I've got a dream

Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it, dreaming
Like everybody else, I've got a dream

Toil would like to quit and be a florist
Gunter does interior design
Urf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime!
Bruiser knits
Killer sews

Big Nose Thug:

Flynn:
Oh, no, no, sorry boys. I don't sing.

Surrounded by enormous piles of money!

And I find I forgot to bring my gun.
I am lost in the jungle all alone and unarmed when I meet a lioness in her lair
Then I'm glad to be back in my own little corner,
All alone in my own little chair.

I swear I'm cold-hearted
There's no negotiation
I'm not here for debatin'
You need some motivation?
Just look at Ben's face
Then ask yourself how long you think I'll remain patient
I'll throw him overboard and let him swim with killer sharks
You either hand over the wand or he'll be ripped apart
Now, let's all just be smart
Although for you that must be hard
You'll get your wand
No one has to come to any harm
Don't try to intimidate
Your bark is much worse than your bite
Who's the baddest of them all?
I guess we're finding out tonight
[Chorus: China & Thomas & Dylan, Dove & Sofia & Cameron & Booboo]
Let's go, bring it on
Better give us what we want
It's the wand for the crown
If you don't, it's going down

Peace or war, it's up to you
Give him up and do it now
If you don't, it's going down
We want the wand

Ok, look, this is not a conversation
It's a do-or-die situation
If you don't give me back the king
I'll have no hesitation
I'll serve you right here
And I don't need a reservation
That way your whole pirate crew can have a demonstration
Release him now, and we can go our separate ways
Unless you wanna deal with me and the VK's
So that's your big speech, huh?
An empty ultimatum?
All it takes is one swing and I'll humiliate him
Matter of fact, make one wrong move and I'll debilitate him
And if he even starts to slip, I'll eliminate him
All it takes is one wrong look and I'll---

Mulan,A Girl Worth Fighting For,"For a long time we've been marching off to battle
In a thundering herd we feel a lot like cattle
Like the pounding beat,
Our aching feet aren't easy to ignore,
Hey! Think of instead, a girl worth fighting for!
Huh?
That's what I said, a girl worth fighting for!
I want her paler than the moon,
With eyes that shine like stars
My girl will marvel at my strength,
Adore my battle scars
I couldn't care less what she'll wear,
Or what she looks like,
It all depends on what she cooks like:
Beef,
Pork,
Chicken,
Mmmm
'Bet the local girls thought you are quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armour
You can guess what we have missed the most,
Since we've been off to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for!
My girl will think I have no faults,
And I'm a major find
Uh,
How about a girl who's got a brain,
Who always speaks her mind?
Nah!
My manly ways and turn of phrase,
Are sure to thrill her!
He thinks he's such a lady killer
I've got a girl at home,
Who's unlike any other
Yeah, the only girl who loves him,
Is his mother!
But when we come home in victory,
They'll line up at the door
What do we want? A girl worth fighting for!
Wish that I had... a girl worth fighting for!
(whistle) 
A girl worth fighting-

The Hunchback of Notre Dame,A Guy Like You,"Hugo:
Paris, the city of lovers
Is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire
But still, there's ""l'amour""
Somewhere out there in the night
Her Heart is also alight
And I know the guy she just might
Be burning for
A guy like you
She's never known, kid
A guy like you

You've got a look
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two?

No way!

All look the same
From ev'ry boring point of view
You're a surprise
From ev'ry angle

She's gotta love
A guy like you

A guy like you
Gets extra credit
Because it's true
You've got a certain some thing more

Want something new?

It's why she fell

For you-know-who

From king to serf
To the bourgeoisie
Hugo:
You ring the bell
Victor and Laverne:
They're all a second-stringer
All Three:
You're the bell ringer!
When she wants oo-la-la
Then she wants you la-la
She will discover, guy
You're one heckuva guy
Who wouldn't love a guy
Like you?
Hugo:
You got a lot
The rest have not
So she's gotta love
A guy like you!

Winnie the Pooh ,A House At Pooh Corner,"(chorus) 
With a few good friends and a stick or 2,
A house is built at a corner called Pooh.
With a friend and a stick or 3 or 4,
A house is built where it wasn't before!
With a window here,
And there a door,
And a nail or a peg,
for the coat of Eeyore.

With a few good friends and a stick or 2,
A house is built at a corner called Pooh.
With a friend and a stick or 3 or 4,
A house is built where it wasn't before!
Dress it down,
Or dress it up,
Invite Tigger for tea,
Or Owl for supper.

Mary Poppins,A Spoonful Of Sugar,"In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap the job's a game
And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree!
It's very clear to see
CHORUS
That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go do-own
The medicine go doown
Just A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest
Has very little time to rest
While gathering bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
he has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along
REPEAT CHORUS
The honeybees
that fetch the nectar
from the flowers
to the comb
never tire of ever buzzing
to and fro,
Because they take
a little nip of every
flower that they sip
-and hence
-and hence
-they find
-they find
Their task is not a grind
""Cheeky,""
""Don't be all day about it please!""
""Let me out! Let me out!""
""Let me out!""
""Well that was very......Thank you now.....When you've quite finished!""

Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you

Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

Lady and the Tramp II,A World Without Fences,"Far from,
Here is,
Where I want to be.
Somewhere,
Out there,
Loose and running,
Nobody's leash to hold me,
Nobody's hugs to crush me,
Nobody's soap,
And scratchy combs
To bathe and brush me,
A world without fences,
Where I can run free,
And be with real dogs,
Will bring the real dog out in me,
No walls and no boundries,
Where I can be free,
A world without
Walls or fences,
That's exactly,
Where I want to be.
This pup,
Just wont,
Sleep his life away,
On some,
Sofa,
Like his father,
Too many bones to chew up,
Too many smells to sample.
Too many fancy flower beds to rip and trample.
No rules to control me,
Thats what I want to be,
A world without fences,
Thats the world I want for me.
No rules,
No responsibilities,
On my own,
Completely free.
A world without fences,
For meeeeeee.

Finding the right thing to say!
But things will be going my way, after today
She looked right through me, and who could blame her?
I need a new me, plus some positive proof that I'm not just a goof, and
After today I'm gonna be cruisin'!
No more pep rallys to cut! Yech!
After today my brain will be snoozin'!
I'm gonna sit on my butt
I've got less than an hour, and when this is ended
I'll either be famous..
Or you'll be suspended!

Gonna be on my own, kiss the parents goodbye
Gonna party from now 'till the end of July

How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or underland
Or just behind a tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land behind the eye
People cannot see
Where can you see
Where do the stars go
Where is the crescent moon
They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder where my life begins
now......
There is only one way....... To Begin!!!!!!!

may be simpler than it seem
If you feel a little shy,
Heres something we can try
I'll just sing a little song,

You can strum, I can hum
Till you wanna sing along
Its on the tip of your tongue,
Just waiting to be sung

Take my lead
A brand new friend
may be all you need.
In our castle, I would float
With the dolphins in the moat.
I'd paint all the towers blue,
But the next parts up to you.

Lets have slides instead of stairs,
Giant trees with koala bears.
Every seat would play a beat,
Cause we'll have musical chairs.

Just waiting to be sung.

Take your lead.

Imagine to look in her eyes and see.
Imagine how miraculous it seems to be,
but itÂ´s not so very rare.
You can find it anywhere.
ItÂ´s an ordinary miracle.
The kind you find around you every single day
or maybe itÂ´s just seasonal like spring and May.
TheyÂ´re so many.
The ordinary miracle.
A common kind of miracle that runs right by
or maybe itÂ´s too gradual to catch your eye
so you miss it.
A sudden bolt of distant lightning.
Cathedrals rising out of stone.
A baby starts to walk and talk one day
then, shockingly, heÂ´s grown
and in love.
That volcano of emotions
not ten thousand gypsy-potions
can undo.
Yes, itÂ´s love
Well, of course my view is slanted,
but people do take love for granted.
Sad, but true.
Of all the many miracles.
Mysterious and marvelous and big and small.
When people fall in love it really beats them all.
Oh, to see it,
to feel it,
to know it
Imagine someone to love who loves you.
Imagine to look in her eyes and see.
Imagine how extraordinary it would be
if an ordinary miracle

The Lion King,Be Prepared,"I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
[Shenzi] And where do we feature?
[Scar] Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!
[Bonzi] Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared.
For what?
[Scar] For the death of the king.
[Bonzi] Why, is he sick?
[Scar] No, fools. We'll kill him. And Simba too!
[Bonzi] Great idea! Who needs a king? No king, no king, la la la la la la.
[Scar] Idiots! There will be a king!
[Bonzi] But you said...
[Scar] I will be king. Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
[Hyenas] Yay! All right!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me
So prepare for the coup of the centrury
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh!) 
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!) 
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food) 
Decades of denial (We repeat) 
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat) 
Be king undisputed (Aaaaaaah!) 
Respected, saluted (Aaaaaaah!) 
And seen for the wonder I am (Aaaaaaah!) 
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Fox and the Hound,Best Of Friends,"When you're the best of friends,
Having so much fun together,
You're not even aware you're such a funny pair,
You're the best of friends.
Life's a happy game,
You could clown around for ever,
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries,
Life's one happy game.
If only the world wouldn't get in your way,
If only people would just let you play,
They'd say you're both being fools,
You're breaking all the rules,
They can't understand,
The magic of your wonderland.
When you're the best of friends,
Sharing all that you discover,
When these moments have passed,
Will that friendship last?
Who can't say there's a way?
Oh I hope,
I hope it never ends,
Cause you're the best of friends.

Together there's no end
To what a dream can start
Like two eagles soar as one
Upon the river of the wind
With the promise of forever
We will take the past and learn how to begin
And we'll build a bridge of love
Between two worlds
With every kiss we'll promise this
We'll find a way to light
The dawn of all we wish
Across the stream of stars we'll reach
An island in the sky
With the moon to guide our way I know
That we can find a home for you and I
And we'll build a bridge of love
Between two worlds
Miles and miles away
Though the journey takes us far
Our love has found a place to stay
If we believe, if we believe
There is no sea, there is no sea
That's wide enough
To keep us from our destiny
Like the snows of every winter melt
And blossom into spring
As the seasons pass, we'll live as one
No what the years ahead may bring
No night is long enough
To end this light that shines on us
We have built a bridge of love
Between two worlds
Yes, we have built a love
Between two worlds

Shining with all its might
He did his very best to make the flow smooth and bright
And this was all because it was the middle of the night

The beach was right from side to side but MUCH too full of sand
'Mr.Walrus!' Said the carpenter, 'My brain begins to perk!'
'We'll sweep this clear in half a year, if you don't mind the work!'
'Work!? The time has come, ' The Walrus said, 'To talk of other things!'
'Of shoes, and ships, and ceiling wax, and cabbages and kings,'
'And why the sea is BOILING hot, and weather pigs have wings!'
'CULOO, CULAAY, no work today,'
'We're cabbages and kings!'
'Oh oisters, come and walk with us, the day is warm and bright!'
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight!'
'And if we perhaps get hungry on the way, we'll stop and...have a bite!'
But mother oister went tally, and shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time to leave her oister bed
'The sea is nice, take my advice, and stay right here, ' Mum said.
'Yes yes of course of course but HA HA the time has come my little friends,'
'To talk of other things!'
'Of shoes and ships and ceiling wax, and cabbages and kings,'
'And why the sea is boiling hot, and weather pigs have wings!'

'Where theres cabbages and kings!'
'Well well now, let me see, a loaf of bread is what we need!'
'How bout some pepper and sault an' vinegar, eh?'
'Yes yes, splendid idea, very good indeed,'
'Now, if you're READY, oisters, dear, we can begin the feed!'
'FEED!?'
'Oh yes! The time has come my little friends, '
'To talk of food and things!'
'Of bethicals and mustard seeds and other seasonings!'
'We'll mix them all together in a sauce that's fit for kings,'
'CULOO, CULAY, we'll eat today!'
'Like cabbages and kings!'
'I weep for you, I dearly sympathize,'
'For I've enjoyed your company much more then you realize!'

And this was scarcely odd cause they'd been eaten,
Every one.

Good luck will rub off when
I shakes hands with you
I choose me bristles
With pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft
And a brush for the flute
Up where the smoke
Is all billered and curled
'Tween pavement and stars
Is the chimney sweep world
When there's hardly no day
Nor hardly no night
There's things half in shadow
And halfway in light
On the rooftops of London
Coo, what a sight
Chim, chimney
Chim, chimney
Chim, chim, cher-ee
When you're with a sweep
You're in glad company
Nowhere is there
A more happier crew
Than them wot sings
""Chim chim cher-ee
Chim cher-oo""

Till shades of night are falling
There isn't any let up
I hear them calling calling
?Go up and do the attic and go down and do the cellar
You can do them both together, Cinderella!?
How lovely it would be If I could
Live my fantasy
But in the middle of my dreaming
They're screaming at me
?Cinderelllllaaaaaa!!!!?

thats the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler
Keep a-busy Cinderelly!
We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball
She'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
I'll cut with these scissors!
And I can do the sewing!
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for

Pocahontas,Colors of the Wind,"(Speech: Pocahontas)

Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know 
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned

Dance Dance Revolution Disneys Rave,Dance With My Father,"Back when I was a child,
Before life removed all the innocence,
My father would lift me high,
And dance with my mother and me and then,
Spin me around 'till I fell, fell alseep,
And up the stairs he would carry me.
And I knew for sure, I was loved.
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him,
I'd play a song the would never, ever end,
How I'd love, love, love, to dance with my father, again.
Oooooh.
When I and my mother would disagree,
To get my way i would run from her to him,
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me,
Oooooh, and finally make me do just what my mother said,
late at night when I fell alseep,
He left a dollar under my sheet,
Never dreamed that he, would be gone from me,
No.
If I could steal, one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him,
I'd play a song that would never, ever end.
'Cause I'd love, love, love, to dance with my father, again.
Again.

Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere
To feel like I belong
I am on my way

I don't care how far
Somehow I'll be strong

I will please the gods

Aladdin 2 ,Don't Come Out Of Thin Air,"[Jasmine] You showed me the world
When i was all locked up inside
You reached out your hand
And took me on a magic carpet ride
One look at your smile and i could see the light
Shinning everywhere
People like you, don't come out of thin air
[Aladdin] Oh Jasmine
You don't understand
There is so much that you don't see
Just think if you can
What growing up had to be like for me
Your father's a man
Who taught you who you are
Mine was never there
So how can you say
I don't come out of thin air
There's so much I want to know
[Jasmine] You've got the chance to learn
[Aladdin] If it means I have to go
[Jasmine] I'll be right here when you return
[Jasmine] Our wedding can wait
[Aladdin] I love you
[Jasmine] I think it's worth this small delay
[Aladdin] Maybe you're right
[Jasmine] And won't it be great
To have your father see our wedding day

[Aladdin] To learn the truth

I can still make it right.
I can see so far in my dreams
I'll follow my dreams
Until they come true.
There is a star waiting to guide us shining inside us
When we close our eyes.
Come with me you will see what I mean
There's a world inside no one else ever sees
You will go so far in my dreams
Somewhere in my dreams your dreams will come true.
Dont let go if you stay close to me
In my dreams tonight you will see what I see
Dreams to dream,
As near as can be
Inside you and me, they always come true.
Inside you and me, they always come true.

Frozen,Fixer Upper,"Is it the clumpy way he walks?
Or the grumpy way he talks?
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped weirdness of his feet?
And though we know he washes well, he always ends up sorta smelly
But you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet
So he's a bit of a fixer upper
So he's got a few flaws
His peculiar brain, dear, his thing for the reindeer
That's outside a few of nature's laws
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, but this we're certain of
You can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love
Is it the way that he runs scared?
Or that he's socially impaired?
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?
Are you holding back your fondness
Due to his unmanly blondness?
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?
He's just a bit of a fixer upper
He's got a couple of bugs
His isolation is confirmation
Of his desperation for healing hugs
So he's a bit of a fixer upper
But we know what to do
The way to fix up this fixer upper
Is to fix him up with you
So she's a bit of a fixer upper
That's a minor thing
Her quote engagement is a flex arrangement
And by the way I don't see no ring
So she's a bit of a fixer upper
Her brain's a bit between
Get the fiance out of the way
And the whole thing will be fixed
We aren't saying you can change him
'Cause people don't really change
We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange
People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed
But throw a little love their way, and you'll bring out their best
True love brings out the best
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
That's what it's all about
Father, sister, brother
We need each other
To raise us up and round us out
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
But when push comes to shove
The only fixer upper fixer
That can fix up a fixer upper is
True
True

True

Tinkerbell Movie,For A Moment,"Melody:
Ok, get a grip, get the hang of this flipper
it's like slipping two feet into one big, huge slipper.
This way is left, but which way is right?
Well now I'll be circling in circles all night.
(Oh, so this is forward? No problem) 
I can't believe I can do this and more,
to swim in the sea like I walk on the shore.
Out of my shell, not closed up like a clam.
Look out sea,
this is me,
here I am!
For a moment all of me
is alive and at home in the sea.
I'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand,
not stubbing my toes, getting stuck in the sand.
For a moment life is cool
i'm a splash in the world's biggest pool.
This is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be.
For a moment, just a moment, lucky me.
Ariel:
If only for one moment
I had shared with you all I know.
The sea wouldn't be a mystery.
Oh why did you have to go?
Melody:
Everything's newer
and brighter and bluer
and truer to life than before
watch me soar!
For a moment I can shine
got a grin and a fin that works fine.
My fingers are wrinkly and I really don't care
if all the curls have curled out of my hair.
For a moment I can feel
all the dreams I've been dreaming are real.
Wish my mother could hear it
the sea is my song.
For a moment, just a moment I belong.
Ariel:
I will find you, my darling.
And the moment that I do
I'll hold you close, my Melody
and sing the song of the sea
with you.
Sing the song of the sea with you.
Melody:
For a moment, just a moment
I belong.

Frozen,For the First Time in Forever (reprise),"Anna: Please don't shut me out again
Please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
'Cause for the first time in forever
I finally understand
For the first time in forever
We can fix this hand in hand
We can head down this mountain together
You don't have to live in fear
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here
Elsa: Anna, please go back home
Your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates
Anna: Yea, but-
Elsa: I know, you mean well
But leave me be
Yes, I'm alone but I'm alone and free
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me
Anna: Actually, we're not
Elsa: What do you mean you're not?
Anna: I get the feeling you don't know

We can change this winter weather

Hunchback of Notre Dame,Forget About Love,"IAGO:
Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrill
The chill
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting!
It's even worse than when you're moulting
Enough of this fluff!
Just forget about love!
JASMINE:
I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
IAGO:
Oh, how I shudder
JASMINE:
The first time we kissed
IAGO:
It won't be missed!
Forget about 'is touch
JASMINE:
I can't forget about his touch
IAGO:
In the scheme of things,
It doesn't matter much
JASMINE:
It matters so mu-uch
IAGO:
You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone
JASMINE:
Hmm-mm-mm-mm
BOTH:
Love's filled with compromises
IAGO:
And don't you hate those big surprises?
JASMINE:
A cozy rendezvous

Oh, please!

Oh, geez!

Look you're calling my bluff!
BOTH:
(I can't) (Just) forget about love!
JASMINE:
I can't forget about my heart
ALADDIN:
I can't forget about my heart
JASMINE:
And how it felt
To fall for you right from the start
ALADDIN:
I'm still falling
JASMINE:
Whatever we may do
ALADDIN:
Whatever we may do
JASMINE:
You are here for me,
And I'll be there for you
ALADDIN:
I'll be there
BOTH:
To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun
Through rain and thunder
ALADDIN:
A cozy rendezvous
JASMINE:
Yes, please!

Candlelight for two

Oh, geez!
Enough is enough!

Princess and the Frog,Friends on the Other Side,"Don't you disrespect me, little man
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now
Not your world
And I got friends on the other side
(He's got friends on the other side) 
That's an echo, gentlemen
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick. Don't worry
Sit down at my table
Put your minds at ease
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please
I can read your future
I can change it 'round some, too
I'll look deep into your heart and soul
(You do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?) 
Make your wildest dreams come true
I got voodoo
I got hoodoo
I got things I ain't even tried
And I got friends on the other side

The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me
Now you, young man, are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty
(I'm a royal myself on my mother's side) 
Your lifestyle's high
But your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough
Mom and dad cut you off, huh playboy?
Now y'all gotta get hitched, but hitchin' ties you down
You just wanna be free
Hop from place to place
But freedom takes green
It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I looked into your future
It's the green that I see
On you, little man, I don't want to waste much time
You been pushed 'round all your life
You been pushed 'round by your mother and your sister and your brother
And if you was married
You'd be pushed 'round by your wife
But in your future, the you I see
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be
Shake my hand
Come on boys
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?
Yes...
Are you ready?

This icy force, both foul and fair, has a frozen heart worth mining

Split the ice apart
And break the frozen heart
Beautiful!
Powerful!
Dangerous!
Cold!
Ice as a magic can't be controlled
Stronger than one
Stronger than ten
Stronger than a hundred men!

Beauty And The Beast,Gaston,"[Gaston] Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with
the wrong man! No one says ""no"" to Gaston!
[LeFou] Heh heh. Darn right.
[Gaston] Dismissed! Rejected! Publicly Humiliated! Why, it's
more than I can bear.
[LeFou] More beer?
[Gaston] What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced.
[LeFou] Who, you? Never! Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
[LeFou] Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favourite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why
[LeFou] No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
[LeFou] No one's been like Gaston
A king pin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
[Gaston] As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating
My- what a guy, that Gaston
[LeFou] Give five ""hurrahs!""
Give twelve ""hip-hips!""
Gaston is the best
And the rest is all drips
[LeFou] No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see I've got biceps to spare
Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny
(That's right!) 
[Gaston] And every last inch of me's covered with hair
[LeFou] No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
[Gaston] I'm especially good at expectorating
(Ptooey!) 
[LeFou] Ten points for Gaston!
[Gaston] When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge
[LeFou] No one shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
[Gaston] I use antlers in all of my decorating
[LeFou] Say it again
Who's a man among men?
And then say it once more
Who's the hero next door?
Who's a super success?
Don't you know? Can't you guess?
[Townspeople] Gaston!

In a world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn
only leads to another
A journey ends, but another begins

No one cares if you grow or if you shrink,
No one dries when your eyes get wet and weepy,

I suppose it all depends,
it's what's unique in each of us

The difference is our differences,
maybe small or great,
variety adds spice to life,
so we should celebrate!
In Harmony, harmony!
You're you I'm me,
together we should sing in Harmony!
If there was only one note,
How boring life would be.
I'm glad there are so many notes,
In many different keys.
I hear each voice singing,
with a special quality,
and when we sing together,
we bring music to the sea!

Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
[Verse 2]
Maybe some moments werenâ€™t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
Weâ€™ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on
[Verse 3]
How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, persists and perseveres
And makes us whole
[Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours, days to years and gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
How does a moment last forever?
When our song lives on......"
Moana,How Far I'll Go,"I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea?
It calls me
And no one knows
How far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea?
it's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
It seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line?
Will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
and no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sails on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know how far I'll go

Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Lament,"There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are reowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I Jack the PUMPKIN KING!
Have grown so tired of the same old thing...
Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
And emptiness begins to grow
There's something out there far from my home
A longing that I've never known
I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
And since I am dead I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal or man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown- if they only understood
He would give it all up if he only could
Oh there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears...

Pocahontas,Just Around The River Bend,"What I love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice.
The water's always changing always flowing
But people I guess can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend
I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send just around the river bend
For me, coming for me
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?
For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming
Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend
I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore, somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend just around the river bend
Just around the river bend
Should I choose the smoothest course steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kokoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream-giver, just around the river bend?

Throw away the key and then

First were going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate
Wait I got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done,
We'll butter him up!

Throw him in a box
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased I do declare
That he will cook him rare

I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more!
You're so stupid!
Think now, if we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green!

Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean than

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around

Of snake and spider stew!

Make me!

This one is real good you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon will be a note to read
Now in the box
They'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him

Beauty and the Beast,Kill The Beast,"Gaston: The beast will make off with your children,
he'll come after them in the night.
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall.
I say we kill the beast!
Man: We're not safe until he's dead.
Man 2: He'll come stalking us at night.
Woman: Set to sacrifice our children to his montrous appetite.
Man 3: He'll wreak havok on our village if we let him wander free!
Gaston: So it's time to take some action boys!
It's time---to---fol---low---me!
Through the mist, through the woods,
through the darkness and the shadows.
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride.
Say a prayer, then we're there,
at the drawbridge of a castle,
and there's something truly terrible inside.
It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones.
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed.
Hear him roar, see him foam,
but we're not coming home,
'till he's dead, good and dead. Kill the beast.
Belle: NO! I won't let you do this!
Gaston: If you're not with us, you're against.
Bring the old man!
Maurice: Get your hands off me!
Gaston: We can't have them running off to warn the creature.
Belle: Let us out!
Gaston: We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me?!
Chorus:
Light your torch, mount you horse,
Gaston:
Screw your courage to the sticking place.
Chorus:
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way.
Through a mist to the wood, where within a haunted castle,
something's lurking that you don't see every day.
It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased.
Sally fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow!
Praise the Lord and here we go!
Gaston: We'll lay seige to the castle, and bring back his head!
Belle: We have to warn the beast. This is all my fault.
OH papa what are we going to do?!
Maurice: Now, now. We'll think of something.
Chip: AWWWWWW!
Chorus: We don't like what we don't...
understand and in fact it scares us,
and this monster is mysterious at least.
Bring your guns, bring your knives,
save children and and your wives,
we'll save our village and our lives!
WE'LL KILL THE BEAST!

Lumiere: Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all.

Hearts ablaze banners high we go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased

When everythingâ€™s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream

The Little Mermaid,Les Poissons,"Les poissons

How I love les poissons
Love to chop
And to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out the bones
Ah mais oui
Ca c'est toujours delish
Les poissons
Les poissons
Hee hee hee
Hon hon hon
With the cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
How, I love little fishes!
Don't you?
Here's something for tempting the palate
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
Then you slash through the skin
Give the belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause that makes it taste nice
(Zut alors, I have missed one!) 
Sacre bleu
What is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab?
Quel dommage
What a loss
Here we go in the sauce
Now some flour, I think
Just a dab
Now I stuff you with bread
It don't hurt 'cause you're dead
And you're certainly lucky you are
'Cause it's gonna be hot
In my big silver pot
Toodle loo mon poisson
Au revoir!

Frozen,Let it go (Demi Lovato version),"Let it go let it go can't hold it back anymore let it go let it go turn my back and slam the door
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation
and it looks like I'm the queen
the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
couldn't keep it in heaven knows I've tried
dont let them in, dont let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal don't feel don't let them know
well now they know, 
(chorus:) 
let it go,
let it go
can't hold it back anymore
let it go,
let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here I stand,
and here I stay
let it go,
let it go
the cold never bothered me anyway 
its funny how some distance
makes everything seem small
and the fears that once controlled me
can't get to me at all
up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
but I'm too relieved to grieve 
let it go,
let it go
can't hold it back anymore
let it go,
let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here I stand
and here I stay
let it go,
let it go
the cold never bothered me anyway 
standing frozen
in the life I've chosen
you won't find me
the past is all behind me
buried in the snow 
let it go,
let it go
can't hold it back anymore
let it go,
let it go
turn my back and slam the door
and here I stand
and here I'll stay
let it go,
let it go the
cold never bothered me anyway
oooooooo...
let it go aaaaaaaawaaaay
nananananana nana nananana
here I stand
let it go,
let it go
ooooooooooooooooo ...
let it go.

Moses - The Plagues,Let My People Go,"[Chorus]
Thus saith the Lord:
Since you refuse to free my people
All through the land of Egypt...
I send a pestilence and plague
Into your house, into your bed
Into your streams, into your streets
Into your drink, into your bread
Upon your cattle, on your sheep
Upon your oxen in your field
Into your dreams, into your sleep
Until you break, until you yield
I send the swarm, I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord 
[Moses]
Once I called you brother
Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh
Was all I ever wanted... 
I send the thunder from the sky
I send the fire raining down 
[Moses]
And even now I wish that God
had chose another
Serving s your foe on his behalf
Is the last thing that I wanted... 
[Chorus]
I send a hail of burning ice
On ev'ry field, on ev'ry town 
[Moses]
This was my home
All this pain and devastation
How it tortures me inside
All the innocent who suffer
From your stubbornness and pride... 
[Chorus]
I send the locusts on a wind
Such as the world has never seen
On ev'ry leaf, on ev'ry stalk
Until there's nothing left of green
I send my scourge, I send my sword
Thus saith the Lord! 
[Moses]
You who I called brother
Why must you call down another blow? 
[Chorus]
I send my scourge, I send my sword 
[Moses]
Let my people go! 
[Moses and Chorus]
Thus saith the Lord! 
[Rameses]
You who I called brother
How could you have come to hate me so?
Is this what you wanted? 
[Chorus]
I send the swarm, I send the horde... 
[Rameses]
Then let my heart be hardened
And never mind how high the cost may grow
This will still be so:
I will never let your people go...

Thus saith the Lord: 
[Moses]
Thus saith the Lord: 
[Rameses]
I will not...

Pirates of the Caribbean,My Jolly Sailor Bold,"Upon one summer's morning,
I carefully did stray
Down by the Walls of Wapping,
Where I met a sailor gay.
Conversing with a young lass
Who seemed to be in pain,
Saying, William, when you go
I fear you'll ne'er return again.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold.
His hair red hangs in ringlets
His eyes as black as coal
My happiness attend him
Wherever he may go.
From Tower Hill to Blackwall
I'll wander, weep and moan
All for my jolly sailor
Until he sails home.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold.
My father is a merchant
The truth I now will tell
And in great London City
In opulence doth dwell.
His fortune doth exceed
300,000 gold
And he frowns upon his daughter
Who loves a sailor bold.
A fig for his riches
His merchandise and gold
True love has grafted my heart
Give me my sailor bold.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold.
Should he return in pov'rty
From o'er the ocean far
To my tender bosom
I'll press my jolly tar.
My sailor is as smiling
As the pleasant month of May
And often we have wandered
Through Ratcliffe Highway
Many a pretty blooming
Young girl we did behold
Reclining on the bosom
Of her jolly sailor bold.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold.
My name it is Maria
A merchant's daughter fair
And I have left my parents
And three thousand pounds a year
Come all you pretty fair maids
Whoever you may be
Who love a jolly sailor
That plows the raging sea
While up aloft in storm
From me his absence mourn
And firmly pray arrive the day
He's never more to roam.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold."

The Lion King 2 Simbs's Pride,My Lullaby,"Hush, my little one; you must be exhausted.
Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king
I've been exiled, persucuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense
But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest
The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lionesses' mournful cry
That's my lullaby
Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is I knows it's petty
But I hate to let them live
So you found yourself somebody who'd chase Simba up a tree
Oh, the battle may be bloody, but that kind of works for me
The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby
Scar is gone... but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
Till he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh-- I mean, precious little thing!
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king!
The pounding of the drums of war
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
The joy of vengeance
Testify!
I can hear the cheering
Kovu! What a guy!
Payback time is nearing
And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky
That's my lullaby!

Aloft with ye mates
Or King Neptune we'll face
You'd think that these land lovers
Never would last
This cargo of pilgrims
Twelve week 'fore the mast
It's land ho me hearties
At last we've arrived
And praise be to God
Nearly all have survived
But a look o'er this wilderness
Brings me to dread
That the first bitter winter
May leave 'em all dead
They call themselves pilgrims
These poor wretched souls
With a dream to be free
In the new world their goal

This place, this time, this friend of mine

found somehow
To look into your heart and
to forgive me now
You've given me the strength to see
just where my journey ends
You've given me the strength

I see the path from this dark place
I see my future
Your forgiveness has set me free
Oh and I can see another way

I see my future
I see the path, I can see the path

Frozen,Olaf's summer song,"Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat
Nope! But sometimes I like to close my eyes
And imagine what it'll be like when summer does come
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer
I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer
Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah boo
The hot and the cold are both so intense
Put 'em together it just makes sense!
Rrr Raht da daht dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah doo
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle
But put me in summer and I'll be a â€” happy snowman!
When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam
Oh the sky would be blue, and you guys will be there too
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer

I have been around the block before with blockheads just like you
Each and everyone of them a disappointment
pain and ache for which there ain't no ointment.
So much for excuses, dumb old kid of Zeus's,
asking me to jump into the frame.
My answer is two words "" O K""
You win! Oh gosh! Oy Vay!
I've givin' hope that someone would come along.
A fella who'd ring the bell for once not the gong.
The kind who wins trophies won't settle for low fees.
At least semi-pro fees, but no I get the green horn.
I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone.
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn.
You need an adviser, a satyr but wiser
A good merchandiser and WHOA there goes my ulcer.
I'm down to one last hope and I hope it's you.
Though kid you're not exactly a dream come true.
I've trained enough turkey's who never came through
You're my one last hope, so you'll have to do.
(music plays) 
Demigods have faced the odds and ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories that you read on all the crockery
To be a true hero kid is a dying art.
Like paintin' a masterpiece it's work of heart.
It takes more than sinew.
It comes down to what's in you.
You'll have continue to grow, now that's more like it.
I'm down to one last shot, and my last high note.
Before that blasted underworld gets my goat.
My dreams are on you kid go make them come true.
Climb that uphill slope, keep pushing the envelope, you're

Born in grief
Raised in hate
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run
Let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive
And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us
Not our kind
Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he will never be one of us
He is not one of us

Never dreamin' that a schemin' sherrif and his posse

So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha
You're jokin', you're jokin'

You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly

If I don't die laughing first
When Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now

And if you aren't shakin'

Hunchback of Notre Dame,Out There,"Frolo:
The world is cruel, the world is wicked
It's I alone who you can trust in this whole city
I am your only friend
I who keep you, teach you, feed you, dress you
I who look upon you without fear
How can I protect you, boy, unless you always stay in here
Away in here.
(Spoken) Remember what I've taught you, Quasimodo.
You are deformed (Quasimodo): I am deformed
And you are ugly (Quasimdo): And I am ugly
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity
You do not comprehend (Quasimodo): You are my one defender
Out there, they'll revile you as a monster (Quasimodo): I am a monster
Out there, they will hate and scorn and jeer (Quasimodo): Only a monster
Why invite their callamir and consternation, stay in here
Be faithful (Quasimodo): I'm faithful
Truly grateful (Quasimodo): I'm grateful
Do as I say, obey, (Quasimodo): I'll stay
(Both): In here.
Quasimodo: Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me.
All my life I memorize their faces,
knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them, but part of them
And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there, all I ask is one
To hold forever, out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give, what I'd dare
Just to live one day out there!
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Everyday they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I was in their skin, I'd treasure every instant
Out there, strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there, like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day, and then I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent,
won't despair,
Old and bent,
I won't care
I'll have spent one day out there!

The only way to get what you want...
...is to become a human yourself!
Ariel:
(Gasps with excitement) Can you do that?
Ursula:
My dear, sweet child,
That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk,
Like yourself...
Poor souls with no one else to turn to...
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light and made a switch
True?
Yes!
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, lonely and depressed
(Pathetic) 
Poor unfortunate souls
In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula please!""
And I help them?
Yes, I do
Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes, I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint...
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?
Ariel:
If I become human...
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

But, you'll have, your man. (laughs slyly) 
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? (laughs slyly) 
Oh!
And there is, one, more, thing!
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
Ariel: But I don't have any -
Ursula:
I'm not asking much.
Just a token, really!
A trifle!
What I want
from you is . . .
...Your voice.
Ariel:
But without my voice, how can I -
Ursula:
You'll have your looks!
Your pretty face!
And don't underestimate
The importance of ... body language!
Ha!
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much:
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul!
It's sad,
But true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
You've got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll!

The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul...
Now sing...

Brush up your sunday salaam

Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali
He's got seventy-five golden camels
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

That physique! How can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Never ordinary, never boring
Everything about the man just plain impresses
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder!
He's about to pull my heart asunder!
And I absolutely love the way he dresses!
He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys

And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous) 
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies

They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key

Just a con, need I go on?
Take it from me

To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth - whoopee!

Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart.
Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?

Have a howler from Ron
The Naked Mole Rap is the
Name of the song
Here's the story
In all it's glory
Ain't hiding nothin?
Don't know what the truth is,
How Ron met Rufus
Never heard a cat yarn
Never heard a puppy kern
My dad's allergic to every kind of fur
So I searched for hairless pets
On the internet
Saw a a'this thing on a pet thing
Gonna need sun screen
What is that, that freaky thing?
(Yes, that's right
It's a naked mole rat) 
C'mon, y'all, let the girlies sing
(Listen to the naked mole rap) 
What is that, that freaky thing?
(Yes, that's right
It's a naked mole rat) 
Hey, wait I can't hear the girlies sing
(Listen to the naked mole rap) 
I heard Smarty Mart was
Havin? a sale
On a hairless pink rodent
With a long skinny tail
It seemed that this could be a solution
The perfect pet for my dad's
Sensitive constitution
So the manager came
To open the cage
He said,
?You know this pet's hairless??
I said I couldn't care less
He handed him to me he said,
?Be careful, don't drop it,
And do you want this cage??
No I keep him in my pocket
What is that, that freaky thing?
(Yes, that's right
It's a naked mole rat) 
C'mon, y'all, let the girlies sing
(Listen to the naked mole rap) 
What is that, that freaky thing?
(Yes, that's right
It's a naked mole rat) 
I'm gonna buy me, some bling bling (Listen to the naked mole rap)

Nightmare Before Christmas,Sally's Song,"I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice, my feelings for him?
And will he see, how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever, end up together? 
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one.

//Jack singing entire song//
So that's what they call a family
Mother, daughter, father, son...
Guess that everything you heard about is true
So you ain't got any family...
Well who said you needed one?
Aint ya glad nobodies waitin up for you?
When I dream, on my own, I'm alone but I ain't lonely...
For a dreamer, night's the only time of day...
When the citie's finally sleepin
And my thoughts begin to stray
And I'm on the train that's bound for Sante Fe...
And I'm free, like the wind, like I'm gonna live forever
It's a feelin time can never take away...
All I need's a few more dollars
And I'm outta here to stay...
Dreams come true, yes they do,
In Sante Fe....
Where does it say ya gotta live and die here?!
Where does it say a guy can't catch a break?!
Why should you always take what you're given?!
Why should you spend your whole life livin trapped where there ain't no future?
Even at Seventeen?
Breakin your back for someone else's sake?
If the life don't seem to suite ya, how bout a change of scene?
Far from the lousy headlines and the deadlines in between?
**Music interlude**
Sante Fe?
Are you there?
Do you swear you won't forget me?
If I found you would you let me come and stay?
I ain't gettin any younger, and before my dying day...
I want space, not just air
Let them laugh in my face I don't care
Save a place, I'll be there...
So that's what they call a family...
Aint you glad you ain't that way?
Ain't you glad you got a dream called Sante Fe?

Goodbye Christopher Robin ,Saying Goodbye,"Saying goodbye baby is hard to do
Especially harder when I say it to you
Seeing you stand there with the tears in your eyes
I give you that last kiss and you started to cry
And even though we've been apart before
I've never got use to this feeling at all
Seeing you stand there as I walk away
You say you love me in a sweet crying face
[Chorus]
Oh I love you, I love you, I love you too
And I hate to, I hate to, to say goodbye
Seeing you stand there with tears in your eyes
It breaks my heart to say goodbye
Time has come for me to go away
I'll know I'll miss you every night and day
Thousands of miles I'll be a distant from you
A million more times I'll be thinking of you
And even though we've been apart before
I've never got use to this feeling at all
Seeing you stand there as I walk away
You say you love me in a sweet crying face
Saying goodbye baby is hard to do
Especially harder when I say it to you

You must learn your scales and your arpeggios
Bring the music ringing from your chest
And not your nose
While you sing your scales and your arpeggios
If your faithful to your daily practicing
You will find you progress is encouraging
Do mi so mi do me so mi fa la so it goes
When you do your scales and your arpeggios
Do mi so do

Like a tree ability will bloom and grow
If you're smart you'll learn by heart what every artist knows

When we are older you'll understand,
It's enough when I say so.
And maybe some things are that simple.

This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
So let them talk if they wanna (if they wanna, if they wanna) 
Let them talk if they're gonna
We're gonna do what we wanna
Let them talk, let them talk
If they wanna, they wanna
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday

Snow White ,Someday My Prince Will Come,"Someday my prince will come
Someday I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper I love you
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I know at the moment we meet
oh, my heart will start skipping a beat
Someday we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true
Someday my prince will come
Someday we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and weddingbells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true

Little Mermaid 2,Someone Like You,"""I peer through windows, watch life go by.
Dream of tommorow and wonder why.
The past is holding me, keeping life at bay.
I wander lost in yesterday.
Wanting to fly, but scared to try.
But if someone like you, found someone like me.
Then suddenly, nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive.
If someone like you found me.
So many secrets, I long to share.
All I have needed is someone there.
To help me see a world I've never seen before.
A love to open every door.
To set me free. So I can soar!
If someone like you, found someone like me.
Then suddenly, nothing would ever be the same.
There'd be a new way to live.
A new life to love.
If someone like you found me.
Ohhh if, Someone like you, found someone like me.
Then suddenly nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing.
And I'd feel so alive.
If someone like you.
Loved me.
Loved me.
Loved me.""

The Rescuers,Someone's Waiting For You,"Be brave little one
Make a wish for each sad litte tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry little one
There'll be a smile where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer in your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll be joy and happiness
And your little world will be bright
Have faith little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave little one
Someone's waiting to love you

Beauty And The Beast,Something There ,"There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see
Well who'd have thought
Well bless my soul
Well who'd have known
Well who indeed
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own
It's so peculiar
We'll wait and see
a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
You know perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Annie ,Something Was Missing(from Annie),"I've made me a fortune, that fortune made ten
been headlined and profiled again and again
but something was missing, I never quite knew
that something was someone but who
my speeches are greeted with thundrous acclaim
with two universities bearing my name
but something was missing each time I got through
that something was someone but who
chorus:
who could that someone be, how could she make it known
someone who'd love me for me, love me for me alone

(dialogue between mr. warbucks and annie) 
the world was my oyster but where was the pearl
who dreamed I would find it in one little girl
yes something was missing but dreams do come true
that someone was no one but you
who would love me for me, alone
the world was my oyster but wgere was the pearl
who dreamed I would find it in one little girl
yes something was missing but dreams do come true
that someone is no one but you

An American Tail,Somewhere Out There,"Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight.
Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there.
And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky!
Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true...

Tarzan,Son Of Man,"Huh
Oh, the power to be strong,
And the wisdom to be wise,
All these things will come to you in time.
On this journey that you're making,
There'll be answers that you'll seek,
And it's you who climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak.

Son of man look to the sky,
Lift your spirit, set it free,
Someday you'll walk tall with pride,
Son of man, a man in time you'll be.
Though there's no one there to guide you,
No one to take your hand,
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man 
Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be 
In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the
ones you love
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's yours to claim in all 
Son of Man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be

Disneyland Park,Sound Of Forever,"I think it's fine watchin it all go by
Stop and worry if you'll know when
The things they start and ask you why
and when it stops, you'll find a need for an end
The good times roll so let them go now
stand back and watch them roll now
the sound of forever is on the road
Flyin high, out of mind for now
takin a walk around this town
thought I knew, forgot somehow
and when it stops, I'll find a need for an end
The good times roll so let them go now
stand back and watch them roll now

And the moon is the only light we'll see
Oh I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So Pumba, Pumba, stand by me, oh oh oh stand by me

Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains they should crumble to the sea

Goofy Movie,Stand Out,"Open up your eyes, take a look at me
Get the picture fixed in your memory
I'm driven by the rythm like the beat of a heart
And I won't stop until I start
To stand out
To stand out
Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waiting in the wings
It ain't a question of ""if"", just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line
Once you're watching every move that I make
You gotta believe that I got what it takes
To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out ...
'Til ya notice me
If the sqeeky wheel's always gettin' the grease
I'm totally devoted to disturbing the peace
And I'll do it all again, when I get done
Until I become your number one
No method to the madness, and no means of escape
Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape
It ain't a question of ""how"", just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin' to send
I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head
And you know I'm going all the way to the end
To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out ...
'Til ya notice me
If I could make you stop and take a look at me
instead of just, walkin' by
There's nothin that
I wouldn't do if it was gettin' you to notice
I'm alive
All I need is half a chance,
a second thought, a second glance
To prove, I got whatever it takes
It's a piece of cake
To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna, stand out, staaaand out
Stand out!
Stand out!
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out
'Til ya notice me

Help us keep the ancient ways
Keep the sacred fire strong
Walk in balance all our days

When I get to know him
We'll find more things to say
One day I will reach him
There has to be a way
Everyone needs someone
He must need someone, too!
When I get to know him better
Here's what I will do
I'll read him stories
From picture books
All filled with wonder
Magic worlds where the impossible
Becomes the everyday
We'll find a mountain-top
And some moon-beams to sit under
I'll lead, because I know the way!
So much to discover
I do it all the time
I could live inside bright pages
Where the words all rhyme
We will slay the dragons
That still follow him around
And he'll smile
Yes, he'll smile
As his dreams leave the ground!
Stories and stories
About mermaids, kings and sunken treasure
Magic worlds where the impossible
Becomes the everyday
I know a tiny place
Just a dot,
Too small to measure
I'll take him there, I know the way!
Stories about heroes
Who overcame
Their deepest sorrows
They'll put hope into his heart again
To cherish everyday
He'll find a better world
And the strength to face tomorrow
I'm sure that when he knows the way
He'll want to stay...

Cinderella,Ten Minutes Ago,"Ten minutes ago I saw you
I looked up when you came through the door
My head started reeling
You gave me the feeling
The room had no ceiling or floor
Ten minutes ago I met you
And we murmured our ""How do you do's?""
I wanted to ring out the bells
And fling out my arms and to sing out the news
I have found her
She's an angel
With the dust of the stars in her eyes
We are dancing, we are flying
And she's taking me back to the skies
In the arms of my love I am flying
Over Mountain, and Meadow and Glenn
And I like it so well that for all I can tell
I may never come down again
I may never come down to earth again
Ten minutes ago I met you
And we murmured our ""How do you do's?""

Lion King 2,That's My Lullaby,"Zeira:
Sleep my little Kovu
let your dreams take wing
one day when you're big and strong
you will be a king
Kovu: Goodnight
Zeira: sleep well my little prince, tomorrow your training intensifies
Zeria:
I've been exiled persecuted
left alone with no defense
when I think of what that brute did i get a little tense
but i dream a dream so pretty
that i dont feel so depressed
'coz it soothes my inner kitty
and it helps me get some rest
the sound of Simba's dying gasp
his daughter squealing in my grasp
his lioness's mournful cry
thats my lullaby
now the past i've tried forgetting
and my foes I could forgive
trouble is I know it's petty
but i hate to let them live
Nuka:
so you found yourself somebody who chased Simba up a tree
Zeira:
oh the battle may be bloody
but that kind of works for me
a melody of angry growls
a counterpoint of painful howls
a symphony of death
oh my
thats my lullaby
Scar is gone
but Zeira's still around
to love this little lad...
'til he learns to be a killer
with a lust for being bad!
Nuka:
Sleep ya little termite..I-I mean precious little thing
Vitani:
one day when you're big and strong..
Zeira:
you will be a king!
the pounding of the drums of war
the thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
Nuka:
the joy of vengeance!
Vitani:
testifies!
Zeira:
I can hear the cheering
Nuke and Vitani:
kovu what a guy
Zeira:
Payback time is nearing
and then our flag will fly...
against a blood red sky!

To pluck you up
When you are down
And when you're outside, looking in
Who's there to open the door?
That's what friends are for!
Who's always eager to extend
A friendly claw?
That's what friends are for!
And when you're lost in dire need
Who's at your side at lightning speed?
We're friends of every creature
Comin' down the pike
In fact we never met an animal
We didn't like, didn't like
So you can see
We're friends in need

Are friends indeed

Bedknobs and Broomsticks,The Age Of Not Believing,"When you rush around in hopeless circles,
searching everywhere for something true,
you're at the age of not believing,
when all the make-believe is through.
When you've set aside your childhood heroes
and your dreams are lost upon a shelf,
you're at the age of not believing
and, worst of all, you doubt yourself.
You're a castaway where no one hears you
on a barren isle in a lonely sea.
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
You must face the age of not believing,
doubting everything you ever knew,
until at last you start believing
there's something wonderful in you.

Hunchback of Notre Dame,The Bells Of Notre Dame,"Clopin
Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city's
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame
Listen, they're beautiful, no?
So many colors of sound, so many changing moods
Because you know, they don't ring all by themselves
- They don't? -
No, silly boy.
Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower
lives the mysterious bell ringer.
Who is this creature - Who? -
What is he? - What? -
How did he come to be there - How? -
Hush, and Clopin will tell you
It is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster.
Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame
Man Shup it up, will you!
Man We'll be spotted!
Gypsy
Hush, little one.
Clopin
Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame
Man Four guilders for safe passage into Paris
Clopin
But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells
Man Judge Claude Frollo
Clopin
The bells of Notre Dame
Chorus
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy) 
Clopin
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin

And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

Guard
You there, what are you hiding?

Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her

She ran

Frollo
This is an unholy deamon.
I'm sending it back to hell, where it belongs.

See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame
Frollo
I am guiltless. She ran, I pursued.
Archdeacon
Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame
Frollo
My conscience is clear

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

And for one time in his life
Of power and control

Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul
Frollo
What must I do?
Archdeacon
Care for the child, and raise it as your own
Frollo
What? I'd be settled with this misshapen ...?
Very well. Let him live with you, in your church.
Archdeacon
Live here? Where?
Frollo
Anywhere
Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see
The bell tower, perhaps
And who knows, our Lord works in mysterious ways
Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

And Frollo gave the child a cruel name
A name that means half-formed, Quasimodo

The planet earth was down on it's luck
And every where gigantic brutes called titans ran amok
It was a nasty place
There was a mess wherever you stepped
Where chaos rained and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept
And then along came Zeus
He hurled his thunder bolt
He zapped
Locked those suckers in a vault
They're trapped
And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks
And that's the gospel truth
The guy was too type 'A' to just relax
And that's the world's first dish
Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth
Though honey it may seem imposs'ble
That's the gospel truth
On Mt. Olympus life was sweet
And smooth as sweet vermouth
Though honey it may seem imposs'ble
That's the Gospel of Truth

Killer claws for the feast

And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns
Bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

Robin Hood ,The Phony King Of England,"Oh the world will sing of an English King
A thousand years from now
And not because he passed some laws
Or had that lofty brow
While bonny good King Richard leads
The great crusade he's on
We'll all have to slave away
For that good-for-nothin' John
Incredible as he is inept
Whenever the history books are kept
They'll call him the phony king of England
A pox on the phony king of England!
He sits alone on a giant throne
Pretendin' he's the king
A little tyke who's rather like
A puppet on a string
And he throws an angry tantrum
if he cannot have his way
And then he calls for Mum while he's suckin' his thumb
You see, he doesn't want to play
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the worst
A pox on that phony king of England!
While he taxes us to pieces
And he robs us of our bread
King Richard's crown keeps slippin' down
Around that pointed head
Ah! But while there is a merry man
in Robin's wily pack
We'll find a way to make him pay
And steal our money back
The minute before he knows we're there
Ol' Rob'll snatch his underwear
The breezy and uneasy king of England
The snivellin' grovellin'
Measly weasely
Blabberin' jabberin'
Gibberin' jabberin'
Blunderin' plunderin'
Wheelin' dealin'
Prince John, that phony king of England
Yeah!

Peter Pan ,The Second Star To The Right,"The second star to the right
shines in the night for you
to tell you that the dreams you plan
really can come true.
The second star to the right
shines with a light so rare.
And if it's Never Land you need,
its light will lead you there.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
so we'll know where you are.
Gleaming in the skies above,
lead us to the land we dream of.
And when our journey is through,
each time we say good night,
we'll thank the little star that shines
the second from the right.

And we'll all be rich and free

There's diamonds like debris
There's silver rivers flow
And gold you pick right off a tree
With a nugget for my Winnie
And another one for me
And all the rest'll go

The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide
From side to side
But much too full of sand
""Mr. Walrus,"" said the Carpenter
""My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in 'alf a year
If you don't mind the work""
""Work?! The time has come,"" the Walrus said
""To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings
Calloo-Callay
No work today!
We're cabbages and kings""
Oh, uh, Oysters, come and walk with us
The day is warm and bright
A pleasant walk
A pleasant talk
Would be a sheer delight
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way
We'll stop and, uh, have a bite?
But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her hairy head
She knew too well
This was no time to leave her Oyster bed
""The sea is nice,
Take my advice
And stay right here,"" Mum said
Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha, ha
The time has come, my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings, ha ha
Callo-Callay
Come, run away
With cabbages and kings!
Well, now, uh, let me see
Ah, a loaf of bread is
What we chiefly need!
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes, splendid idea, ha ha!
Very good, indeed
Now, if your ready, Oysters, dear.
We can begin the feed.
Feed?!
Oh, yes, the time has come, my little friends
To talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seeds
And other seasonings!
We'll mix 'em all together
In a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo-Callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings!
I, uh, weep for you. I (hic) , oh excuse me
I deeply sympathise
For I've enjoyed your company, oh much more
Than you realize
Little Oysters? Little Oysters?
But answer, there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten
Every one!

And out of the silence
That songs come to be
And all that we dream of
Awaits patently
There is life

does it think that it's more important
than the stones that forms the base
So how can you see what your life is worth
or where your value lies
ohhhh, you can never see through the eyes of man
you must look at your life
look at your life through heaven's eyes
lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X) 
A lake of gold in the desert sand
is less than a cool fresh spring
and to one lost sheep, a shepard boy
is greater than the richest king
should a man lose everything he owns
has he truly lost his worth
or is it the beginning
of a new and brighter birth
So how do you measure the worth of a man
in wealth or strength or size
in how much he gained or how much he gave
the answer will come to ya
to look at his life through heaven's eyes
lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X) 
and that's why we share all we have with you
though there's little to be found
when all you've got is nothing
there's lots to go around
No life can escape being blown about
by the winds of change and chance
and though you never know all the steps
you must learn to join the dance
you must learn to join the dance
lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(repeat until fade)"
Winnie the Pooh ,Tigger Song,"The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is Tiggers are wonderful things.
Their tops are made of rubbers
The bottoms are made of springs.
They're
Bouncy,
Flouncy,
Trouncy,
Pouncy,

The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is I'm the only one

 everyone else is jealous, that's why I repeat and repeat,
Tiggers are wonderful fellows, tiggers are lovely chaps,
They love to leap on their bottoms,
They love to leap in your laps!
They're bouncy flouncy trouncy pouncy, fun! Fun! Fun!
But the more wonderful thing about Tiggers of course,
I'm the only one, yes, I'M the only one!

Hunchback of Notre Dame,Topsy Turvy,"Come one, come all
Leave your looms and milking stools,
coop the hens and pen the mules
Come one, come all
Close the churches and the schools
it's the day for breaking rules
Come and join the Feast of.....Fools!
Once a year we throw a party, here in town
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down
Every man's a king and every king's a clown
once again it's Topsy Turvy Day
It's the day the devil in us gets released
It's the day we mock the pig and shock the priest
Everything is topsy turvy at the Feast of Fools
Topsy Turvy
Everything is upsy-daisy
Topsy Turvy
Everyone is acting crazy
Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet
that's the way on Topsy Turvy Day
Topsy Turvy
Beat the drums and blow the trumpets
Topsy Turvy
Join the bums and theives and strumpets
streaming in from Chartres to Calais
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
on the 6th of January
all because it's Topsy Turvy Day
Come one, come all
Hurry, hurry here's your chance,
see the mystery and romance
Come one,come all
See the finest girl in France
make an entrance to entrance
Dance la Esmeralda.......
Dance!!
Here it is, the moment you've been waiting for
Here it is, you know exactly what's in store
Now's the time we laugh until our sides get sore
Now's the time we crown the King of Fools!!
So make a face that's horrible and frightening
make a face as gruesome as a gargoyle's wing
for the face that's ugliest will be the King of Fools
Why?
Topsy Turvy
Ugly folk, forget your shyness
Topsy Turvy
You could soon be called ""Your Highness""
Put the foulest features on display
Be the king of Topsy Turvy Day
Everybody
Once a year we throw a party, here in town
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down
Once a year the ugliest will wear a crown
Once a year on Topsy Turvy Day
Hail to the king
Oh, what a king
Girls, give a kiss
We've never had a king like this
And its the day we do the things that we deplore
on the other three hundred and sixty-four
Once a year we love to drop in, where the beer is never stoppin'
For the chance to pop some popinjay
And pick a king who'll put the top in Topsy Turvy Day
Topsy Turvy
Mad and crazy,upsy-daisy,Topsy Turvy Day!"

Nightmare Before Christmas,Town Meeting,"JACK
There were object so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you
This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box
DEVIL
A box?
Is it steel?
WEREWOLF
Are there locks?
HARLEQUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?
DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox
JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow
WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?
JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know
CLOWN
It's a bat
CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
Will it bend?
CLOWN
It's a rat
CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
Will it break?
UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake
JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land
Now, pay attention
Now we pick up an over-sized sock
And hang it like this on the wall
MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?
MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look
SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?
JACK
Hmm, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
or sometimes it's filled with small toys
MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys
WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?
MUMMY
Do they snap?
WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?
CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys
MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
Why, I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once
JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome King with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand
And I've also heard it told
That's he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And sets out to slay with his reindeer on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said
And on a dark cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws
Well, at least they're excited
Though they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

another's eyes
Everything will become clear to you
Whatever's meant for you, you will find

Everything you need to be the one

And all of those things that you feared
Will disappear from you in time

Will cease to resist

Take strength from those that need you
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams

But danger's no stranger here
No words describe a mother's tears
No words can heal a broken heart

Somewhere something is calling for you

Down where it's wetter,

Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin?
Full time to floatin?

Down here all the fish are happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy

But fish in the bowl is lucky

One day when the boss gets hungry
Guess whos gonna be on the plate(uh-oh)

Fry us and eat us in fricasee
We what the land folk love to cook

We got no troubles life is the bubbles
Under the sea, under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here, naturally

We got the spirit

The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass

And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom

And rhino rumba in a conga line
All the pink flamingos are intertwined
As the stars come out to play

To make it through

Cause the path is steep

But falling is half the fun

That explains the trouble that I'm always in

And I'd love the change
Should something strange begin
Well, I went along my merry way
And I never stopped to reason
I should have known there'd be a price to pay
Some day, some day

But I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn to do the things I should?

Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend of how the wind blows I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul
Chorus
I'm not the average girl from your video
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally,
Because I am a queen

My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be

Verse 2
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's suppose to be
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my Lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see

Verse 3
Am I less of a lady if I don't where panty hose
My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows?
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception,
Something got to change
Now don't be offended this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession
Of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in
Go on and shine
Clear your mind
Now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself
'Cause everything's gonna be alright

Out
Keep your fancy drink, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All's I need is my guitar
Keep your crystal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need you silicone, I prefer my own
What god gave me is just fine?

What If,What If,"Here I stand alone
with this weight upon my heart
and it will not go away
in my head I keep on looking back
right back to the start
wondering what it was that made you change
Well I tried, but I had to draw the line
and still this question keeps on spinning in my mind
What if I had never let you go
would you be the man I used to know
If I'd stay If you'd tried, if we could only turn back time
But I guess we'll never know...
Many roads to take
some to joy, some to heart-ache
any one can move away
and if I said that we could turn back
right back to the start
would you take the chance and make it change?
Do you think, how it would have been sometimes?
do you pray that I'd never left your side?
What if I had never let you go
would you be the man I used to know
If I'd stay. If you'd tried, if we could only turn back time
But I guess we'll never know...
If you want me to turn the hands of time
If I could turn it back would you stay as mine?
'coz I tried, but I had to draw the line
and still this question keeps on spinning in my mind
What if I had never let you go
would you be the man I used to know
What if I had never walked away
'coz I still love you more than I can say
If I'd stay. If you'd tried, if we could only turn back time

There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs
What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this?
What's this?
There's children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead
There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?
What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?
The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?

Toy Story 2,When Somebody Loved Me,"when somebody loved me
everything was beautiful
every hour we spent together
lives within my heart
and when she was sad
i was there to dry her tears
and when she was happy so was i
when she loved me
through the summer and the fall
we had each other that was all
just she and i together like it was meant to be
and when she was lonely
i was there to comfort her
and i knew that she loved me
so the years went
by i stayed the same
but she began to drift away
i was left alone
but still i waited for the day
when she'd say i will always love you
Lonely and forgotten
i never thought she'd look my way
when she smiled at me
and held me
just like she used to do
like she loved me
when she loved me
when somebody loved me
everything was beautiful
every hour we spent together
lives within my heart
when she loved me.

Tangled,When will my life begin?,"7 AM, the usual morning lineup:
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.
And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin?
Then after lunch its puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriliquy candle making
Then I'll stretch maybe sketch, take a climb
Sew a dress
And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more,
I'm sure there's room somewhere.
And then I'll brush and brush,
and brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been.
And I'll keep wonderin' and wonderin'
And wonderin' and wonderin'
When will my life begin?
And tomorrow night,
Lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year.
What is it like
Out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older,
Mother might just
Let me go..."

No.
Here I go...
Just smell the grass! The dirt! Just like I dreamed they'd be!
Just feel that summer breeze - the way it's calling me
For like the first time ever, I'm completely free!
I could go running
And racing
And dancing
And chasing
And leaping
And bounding
Hair flying
Heart pounding
And splashing
And reeling
And finally feeling
Now's when my life begins!

The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue

They would sit and talk to me for hours
When I'm lonely in a world of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds 
Within that world of my own
I could listen to a babbling brook
And hear a song that I could understand
I keep wishing it could be that way
Because my world would be a Wonderland

 Wreck-It Ralph,Wreck-It,"Wreck-It Ralph is a giant of a man
Nine feet tall with really big hands
Living in a stump on his very own land
Until his world went crazy
He was minding his own business on the day they came
They showed a piece of paper saying ""eminent domain""
They built an apartment building saying progress was to blame
But he got mad, and he turned bad
Brick by brick, he's gonna take his land back
Wreck-It Wreck-It Ralph as fast as you can
You know you can do it with your colossal hands
So don't let Fix-It Felix and that building stand
I'll wreck it, I'll fix it, I'll wreck it, I'll fix it
(You fixed it!) 
Fix-It Felix is a really great guy
Watch him get all turbo-charged when he eats a pie
Not just a superintendent he's a super super guy
And everybody loves him
With his trusty toolbelt and steel-toed shoes
Nicelanders believe that Felix just can't lose
So when Wreck-It Ralph starts to come unglued
He doesn't get mad, 'cause he's so rad
Brick by brick, he's gonna build it back
Fix-It Fix-It Felix as fast as you can
Use the magic hammer you got from your old man
But you know Wreck-It Ralph won't let that building stand
I'll wreck it, I'll fix it, I'll wreck it, I'll fix it
Every level tension's getting stronger
So be careful just a little longer
You'll get a medal when your work is true
Just for you, just for you, just for you
Wreck-It Wreck-It Ralph as fast as you can
You know you can do it with your colossal hands
So don't let Fix-It Felix and that building stand
I'll wreck it, I'll fix it
Fix-It Fix-It Felix as fast as you can
Use the magic hammer you got from your old man
But you know Wreck-It Ralph won't let that building stand
I'll wreck it, I'll fix it, I'll wreck it, I'll fix it
You fixed it!

See I could spit a line, but it's more than my words

You wish...That he'd feel the way you feel inside
You hope and you pray, keep it all locked away
As you see yourself lost in his kiss...You wish
You think you know just how to read him
And then he throws you right off track
And all you know is how much you need him
Time will tell you where his heart is really at
You wish...Every time a star falls from the sky
You wish...That he'd feel the way you feel inside
You hope and you pray, keep it all locked away
As you see yourself lost in his kiss...You wish
Late at night
You wonder what he's thinking of
It's killing you
And all that's true
Is you're falling deeper in love
You wish...Everytime a star falls from the sky
You wish...That he'd feel the way you feel inside
You hope and you pray, keep it all locked away
As you see yourself lost in his kiss...You wish
Everytime a star falls from the sky

Yes, it's really me, it's Maui: breathe it in!
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod!

For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below

Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome!
To stretch the days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome!
To fill your sails and shake your trees

For the islands I pulled from the sea

You're welcome!
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome!
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground, oh
That was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson
What is the take-away
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini-Maui just tippity-tappin'
Well, anyway let me say you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

Hercules,Zero To Hero,"Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll hi
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that
When he smiled
The girls went wild with
Oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face
On ev'ry vase
(On ev'ry ""vahse"") 
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?
Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk
Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules
Is he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet
Our fav'rite flavor
Hercules, Hercules ...
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited
He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
He hit the heights at breackneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes indeed!"
